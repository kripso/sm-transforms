"I do, princess. Almost as much as I love you calling me that," he purred, @HisProtegee He gently applied the cream to the marks, taking sick delight in the fact they would stay for a long while.

Understand?", @HisProtegee "Just do well. I'm sure you'll be fine, however." He sat back in his seat, watching her as she moved., @HisProtegee He nodded. "As you like. I'll find some jobs for you, then." He sipped his coffee, still watching her. "Any particular case~, @HisProtegee He leant back. "Would you like to work for me? I could use a mind like yours.."

You are all probably great neighbors and friends. Not criminals.\n\nMy consular work did teach me that there are benefits of citizenship for which we do not charge., @caseytoussaint1 @eviedogpuppy @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Yes, one of the possible consequences of tax evasion is arrest. \n\nYou are an American. All American citizens pay taxes. If you don't want to pay taxes you can renounce (consequence: losing your U.S. passport) or face the IRS (consequence: possibility of jail)., @gfrancie @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad States can make their own rules for state+local elections - that's just one of the effects of federalism.\n\nFor federal elections, it should be straightforward and expats should absolutely contact their closest U.S. consulate for assistance if needed.\n\nhttps://t.co/xIIo2yV5eT, @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad And this is exactly what I mean. \n\nThe US has a "right" to tax income that flows to US citizens because those recipients are US citizens. \n\nThat's where we disagree, and yet this disagreement means I am a "clear and present danger"? That's absurd., @caseytoussaint1 @eviedogpuppy @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Yes, there's a high degree of voting rights between states! This is definitely an issue for the federal government to look at.\n\nAt a minimum no expat should be paying state taxes if they cannot vote.\n\n*Federally, this is mostly fixed, though there's certainly room for improvement, @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad 1. Everyone pays federal and state taxes. That's like double taxation in many ways.\n2. We have a federal system based on States. The overseas community is not a State. Luckily for you, you have more representation - however diluted - than residents of D.C., @caseytoussaint1 @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury This is a completely valid complaint and I agree: no one should be forced to maintain a citizenship they no longer want because of a bureaucratic holdup., @Amy_From_Sydney @BlognDog @CrossBriton @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @POTUS45 @BarackObama Neither of them are citizens of Scotland/UK or Kenya!\n\nThis is the difference between citizenship and heritage., @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad 1. I encourage renouncing U.S. citizenship when people feel like being an American is too much trouble. Unwilling to pay taxes = definitely unwilling to serve the draft.\n2. If their other citizenship requires it.\n3. They can be both (I was a Consular Officer in Mexico: trust me.), @USAccidental @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth If they do not feel American then they should renounce their U.S. citizenship at age 18.\n\nI think that process should be free and easy., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad This isn't a productive discussion. It's not an issue that ANY of my constituents (which yes, means BOTH residents of CD-1 and CD-1 voters who live overseas) have raised. \n\nThis just feels like me getting insulted by a bunch of Americans living in France. It's well... miserable., @FixTheTaxTreaty @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury Great. Makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nHowever, it doesn't sound like you identify as an American or value U.S. citizenship. That's fine, but if you want "one set of rules" you should have one citizenship to match., @houckamania @zuludogm @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth You know what, you're absolutely right. Disability and support payments should be exempted under the FEIE. Yet another reform to bring to Congress., @caseytoussaint1 @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury Then this hypothetical person should absolutely renounce upon turning 18. It's very clear in that case that they aren't renouncing to avoid taxes, but rather because they don't identify as an American. Which is fine, and is not derogatory for the purposes of a visa., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Laura, you're a lawyer. You know that precedence does not require direct applicability. \n\nThis interpretation of COOK was accepted by the Supreme Court., @InnovatorsX @eviedogpuppy @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Absolutely!\n\nWrite to your representatives, write op-eds, engage on Twitter. Make your case! That's how democracy works!\n\nI'd recommend against saying that anyone who disagrees with you is a "clear and present danger" though. That level of vitriol tends to be counterproductive., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Laura, this has obviously hit a nerve, but take a step back here for a second:\n\n1. Yes, citizenship is absolutely a human right.\n\n2. It comes with obligations: taxes, the draft, etc.\n\n3. The limit of countries that can tax you is # of citizenships + primary residence., @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury Yes, children should renounce US citizenship if they have multiple nationalities and don't see themselves as Americans.\n\nAs a veteran, maybe I see citizenship as a set of responsibilities more than many here - who seem to see it as a costless entitlement., @houckamania @AccidentallyUSC @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad They can vote in federal elections. Congress, Senate, Presidential., @gfrancie @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad I worked on voting awareness in Tijuana, Mexico as a vice-consul (State Department) for the 2016 election. \n\nNot all embassies are the same, but we took our FVAP role seriously. None of my State Department friends thought 2020 was any different.\n\nOften, it just takes longer., @BlognDog @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @OECDtax Yes, they will resist it. It doesn't mean we should not push for reforms., @BlognDog @Amy_From_Sydney @CrossBriton @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @POTUS45 @BarackObama Because they were making consular services dependant on paying taxes. Consular services are a right under the Vienna Conventions., @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Because I know people that died with an American flag on their shoulder, making 25k/year (though, to be clear, we got a lot of benefits). \n\nCitizenship has obligations.\n\nThere's a lot to fix with FATCA - but just getting rid of extraterritorial taxation isn't it., @eviedogpuppy @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad I read it, and thanks for posting the link. There are absolutely things the U.S. government should do to make filing abroad easier.\n\nBut I firmly believe that overseas residents should pay taxes. For those expats that don't want to pay taxes, they are free to renounce., @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth Citizenship is a human right.\n\nAvoiding taxes is not a human right.\n\nIf #americansabroad do not pay their taxes, they will not lose their citizenship - but they will face arrest upon their return to the U.S. for tax evasion., @joshtpm There's already a provision in the law to do this. The problem is that the @StateDept and @USTreasury do not allow Consular Officers to impose this type of ban.\n\nHow to give the law teeth? Congress should amend 212(A)(10)(E) and empower U.S. Consuls to impose ineligibilities. https://t.co/tRPnaEqQqL, @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury If you don't want the entitlements of citizenship than you should not reap the benefits. \n\nYou should absolutely be *allowed* to renounce, but don't expect to come back on vacation. At that point you're just a foreigner who doesn't support America., @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Of course, if these bureaucratic reforms are insufficient, then it seems the real complaint is about paying taxes at all.\n\nRegrettably, we disagree there; but I had the decency to listen, respond, and tell you why., @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Yes, most Americans I met in Mexico were dirtbags - because I was in charge of visiting Americans in PRISON. I met THOUSANDS of Americans in jail... didn't charge any $, and proudly provided consular services. \n\nAnd reading this as an insult doesn't seem like misrepresentation... https://t.co/ltNUtAEy37, @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth You're on the Tax Advisory Panel and you are suggesting that there should not be penalties for Americans - at home or abroad - failing to pay their taxes?\n\nMaking Americans pay the taxes they owe is not a violation of their rights., @wisecroneknows @BlognDog @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @OECDtax Absolutely spot on. The U.S. should try much harder to enforce international collection against hidden assets in the U.S. \n\nIt's absolutely shameful that we are seen as a tax haven., @AccidentallyUSC @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad You do have representation.

That is definitely not a poor/middle class problem.\n\nhttps://t.co/qxEPURwU0k, @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad And yet, this disagreement has been met with a barrage of criticism: saying I hate Americans, saying I should pay British taxes (I'm not a British citizen...), or saying CBT is unconstitutional (the Supreme Court found it constitutional in 1924)., @Amy_From_Sydney @caseytoussaint1 @CrossBriton @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @POTUS @VP @WhiteHouse @SenWarren @POTUS45 @BarackObama To disincentivize situations like this.\n\nhttps://t.co/dnk00p6KIh, @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad I can tell that the #americansabroad community feel underserved and ignored by Congress.

Small wonder no one else engages with you., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad This isn't about Ruml.

You can vote abroad.\n\nI'm sure you know this, but here's a link to voting information:\n\nhttps://t.co/xIIo2yV5eT, @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad I completely agree: renouncing U.S. citizenship should be free and easy (of course, assuming you have another citizenship). \n\nI will fight to end those fees in Congress., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Well the Supreme Court has certainly found FATCA legal. \n\nThe Court determines constitutionality, not the internet. FATCA is constitutional.\n\nhttps://t.co/NnceMSyySx, @Amy_From_Sydney @caseytoussaint1 @CrossBriton @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @POTUS @VP @WhiteHouse @SenWarren @POTUS45 @BarackObama Great. You are a prime candidate for renouncing your citizen and voiding your U.S. passport.\n\nI fully support your right to do so freely and easily., @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth And this is a great article. Link here: https://t.co/D4XIc56YHd\n\nThe IRS should absolutely implement many of these recommendations, because paying taxes should be as easy as possible.\n\nI do not believe it should be optional, even for #americansabroad., @gfrancie @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad This is a completely logical complaint about FATCA and the IRS.\n\nIt is a fundamentally different argument than "I don't benefit from U.S. citizenship abroad" (expats absolutely do) or "No taxation without representation" (expats can vote)., @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad It is actually my military service that has more impact. I think citizenship entails obligations. I love America and I enlisted because I love America. Same for taxes.\n\nIt comes across as very odd to me that Americans view their citizenship as an unbearable burden., @gorakaunhai @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad 1. No idea - but that doesn't make it wrong.\n2. We (and Europe) objected to Eritrea withholding consular services from those who didn't pay.\n3. The cost of renouncing is high because the US places great value on citizenship., @ross_unborn @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad If elected to Congress, I will press @USTreasury and the IRS to publish a country-by-country guide to help #americansabroad meet their #FATCA obligations as easily as possible., @BlognDog @Amy_From_Sydney @CrossBriton @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @POTUS45 @BarackObama Or we could make it easier to renounce US citizenship for those who don't want to pay taxes.\n\nYou should not keep your citizenship AND not pay taxes., @BlognDog @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury No. I'm saying that there is a law against allowing entry to those who renounce to avoid taxes. (Not against people who renounce because they don't see themselves as Americans.)\n\nI think that law should be enforced., @ross_unborn @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad There's a $112,000 exemption. These are not the "poor/middle class". I don't mean to call you a liar, but your statement is clearly biased towards hyperbole.\n\nBeing denied financial services is a valid concern, but digitalization is reducing compliance costs yearly., @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad As a Consular Officer, I visited a lot of Americans in jail or hospitals overseas. Many of those people were dirtbags, some were just unlucky.\n\nMost people never need a fire department, but everyone pays for them., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Does that mean FATCA is perfect? No. It's miserably complicated and feels like an insult for those living abroad.\n\nBut it feels like many in the #americansabroad community are dead set against #CBT in principle. We disagree., @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury Of course. I see myself as Irish-American. I don't have Irish citizenship though and would never serve in the Irish Army.\n\nMany people will remain culturally American. That is distinct from citizenship., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad Laura, as I have written many, many times: I consider extraterritorial taxation a component of U.S. citizenship.\n\nI agree that it should be easier to pay taxes overseas and easier to renounce citizenship if those taxes seem too onerous.\n\nBut I think citizenship should have costs., @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @TreyEx_SaxoTink @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad I'm criticizing your "sovereign citizen" approach to foreign taxation. Wherein somehow identifying citizenship as a human right (I agree) means that you cannot be taxed on it? That logic doesn't even make sense.\n\nCitizenship is a right that imposes obligations, like taxes., @Keith__REDMOND @ross_unborn @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad @USTreasury Well, it's been a fun afternoon engaging with #FATCA Twitter, but I think we're done here.\n\nI guess there's nothing MORE American than calling taxes anti-America, and those that support taxes as "hating America". \n\nHave a great afternoon all!, @zuludogm @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad If #americansabroad are registered to vote in Northern California, then yes, I would represent them.\n\nYou're really reading what you want into my statements. I thought it was clear that I do not represent all Americans overseas. Sorry for the misunderstanding., @eviedogpuppy @caseytoussaint1 @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad If you'd rather vote for a politician who ignores you rather than a politician who disagrees with you, that's your right as an American.\n\nIf you read my replies, you'll see I support many bureaucratic changes to make paying taxes/renouncing easier. I guess that's not enough., @scotland4bernie @caseytoussaint1 @wisecroneknows @joshtpm A completely valid complaint.\n\nhttps://t.co/GNvGizFuqc, @FixTheTaxTreaty @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury Yes, you should have the freedom to move and the freedom to renounce if you don't want to pay American taxes after moving.\n\nThe most important lesson I've learned today is that renouncing should be free and not require an appointment., @gfrancie @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad And that time investment can be considerable! \n\nThe federal government should explore how to make it easier and faster, while cognizant that overseas voting represents unique security risks., @Amy_From_Sydney @BlognDog @CrossBriton @wisecroneknows @joshtpm @StateDept @USTreasury @POTUS45 @BarackObama It's really hard to JUST target tax cheats. FATCA was absolutely intended to catch tax cheats abroad., @zuludogm @TAPInternation @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth What's your definition of "lower and middle income households"? The first $112,000 are exempted for tax year 2022, so that seems to address your concerns about regressive taxation.\n\nhttps://t.co/FcvmhajPDZ, @TAPInternation @eviedogpuppy @joshtpm @jmpolander @skywalkerbeth @DemsAbroad I disagree with many Democrats on many things. I also represent Americans in northern California, not those abroad.\n\nThat said, I think I speak for many Dems when I say that if want U.S. Marines to rescue you when you're in trouble overseas, you should pay your taxes overseas.]</td>

But that rate is based on his government salary only., @TheViashino @DeviousKindly @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt I wouldn’t debate the guy.  He claims to have better sources than professionals in the industries while being an 8th grade science teacher with 2 useless masters degrees.  The guy is full of himself., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Omg, congratulations!!!  Sounds like you are greatly accomplished in practiced, applicable science.  Pathetic.  Well, I’m tired and I need my beauty sleep.  Maybe when I’m gone for the evening, you can keep posting to an empty reply thread, talking to yourself.  😘, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Your just a pathetic grade school teacher who has an inferiority complex.  Well, glad you feel inferior, champ.  I’d feel the same way in your position.  😘😘😘, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt ???  Interesting response.  Sounds like you need some of that higher education.  Keyboard warrior and uneducated droog., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Says 8:48am.  Never said lack of healthcare doesn’t cost lives.  Alluded to the government, aka universal HC, is not good at handling healthcare management.  Never denied climate change.  Only denying that scientists don’t have the necessary data to show that it’s on humanity…, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Aren’t you a public school teacher?  Pretty sure school starts around 8-830am in the regular world.  Yet again, no credibility to be lecturing anyone else.  Try again, champ., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt No, they are not.  The last reply was 3 hrs ago, champ., @markcojuangco @DeviousKindly @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Seriously, I wouldn’t try to debate him.  He’s already determined that you are wrong and he is right., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt And he keeps going…so, 8th grade science teacher is the lane of geological, geochemical or climatology expert?  Ok, got it.  Thanks for my last laugh of the day., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Well, much of what you say is striking misleading, but, ok., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt If it’s not that hard, why aren’t you doing it?  Btw, still school hours for the left coast.  Seems someone doesn’t actually teach anything.  😘, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Well, unfortunately, the data summary is in the eye of the interpreter.  Which you dont have the wherewithal to do.  Also, science, according to the great Geophysicist Carl Sondergeld, is not made by committee or vote, models are always wrong, and science is it’s own entity. 😘, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Pretty sure the Left Coast isn’t run by Republicans.  Neither is almost any major city…but, keep going., @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @TheViashino @dtopley1 @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Others pointed to the EIA and pushed ole comrade here to do the basics of going to the website himself.  Yet, the “8th Grade Science Teacher” continued to be a lazy commie, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt My parents were poor and still paid their own healthcare, champ., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt You do know that everything you read on the internet isn’t real, right?, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt “Factual”.  Sure, whatever you say, guy., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Says the 8th grade science teacher…pahahahahahaha, debates just aren’t your thing.  Maybe go get a 3rd masters in organizational gender theory.  That’ll be just as useless as the first 2., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt You know how I know you don’t know anything about climate change?  The fact that you know zero terminology and are accusing a random person of public data falsities on Twitter in an industry of 10 million just in the US.  So, no, I don’t falsify data., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Wow, I get 3 new tweets?  Lucky day.  60s?  Jesus, how old are you?  And you still haven’t learned that communism is not a good thing?  I feel sorry for your students.  Still…zero.credibility…next, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Well, maybe they could be.  But with you as their teacher, I sincerely doubt it.  Zero credibility…still.  Next, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Yes, Bernie, AOC, etc are communists.  Even Biden nominated Saule Omorova, another communist., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Lying?  Like Phil Jones, the British climate scientist who faked his data?  Or Stephen Schneider from Stanford who faked data going into climate modelling?, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Sure.  Mass psychosis must be real., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Where is your proof that how the Us Gov manages health insurance issues saves that many lives?, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Hahahaha, sounds like you like that “free” healthcare.  Having other people pay for your life is sooo nice.  Rainy day health insurance is cheap, even now.  Dieting and basic exercise significantly reduces heart disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, most cancers, etc., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt How stupid do you have to be to promote “free” healthcare, “free” college ed, and attack an innocent person while pushing to have him “retried” in court?  That took me a grand total of 30 seconds to find.  Wonder what other Gulag shit infests your wall., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Wow, you kept going.  Pathetic commie, @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @TheViashino @dtopley1 @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Wow, you kept going into the cast evening.  And now you are softening the issues with the Soviet Union…comrade, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Yes, that’s what the therapist had to tell you.  We know., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt And yours?  It’s about knowing what to cite and not what to cite and the potential credibility of the authors.  Just because someone has a “Dr” in front of their names doesn’t mean their modeling is correct., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Or like millions of people rioting over a few months in 2020, murdering hundreds, then the politicians you voted for bail them out?  You really want this debate?  Dumbdumb, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Sure thing, champ. 😘, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt So, you spent all that money getting 2 masters in order to teach 8th grade science?  My god…and yes, when the person has absolutely ZERO definitional credibility on any matter they are speaking, and it shows in their chosen profession and life, then the person matters 😘, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Sure.  You win the Keyboard battle, champ.  Happy that you think it’s something to be happy about.  I mean, you are the sort that pushes for participation trophies., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt This is another blatant lie.  You easily have an axe to grind and it shows in your hatred of energy sources you don’t like.  Pathetic 8th grade science teacher., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Says the guy who’ll burn down his country to serve his own pathetic pride., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Well, I guess we’ve all lost the now 7th grade science teacher?  You’ve been demoted in just the last hour?, @markcojuangco @DeviousKindly @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Thanks for slapping this guy around on nuclear.  He tried to pull me into a climate change debate that he knows nothing about., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Your participation trophy keeps getting more colorful.  🤡, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt You know how I know you’re full of shit?  You have yet to push promoting a healthy lifestyle instead of the taxpayer footing the bill for fat asses unhealthy decisions or someone who doesn’t like to use a condom., @markcojuangco @DeviousKindly @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Also, gasoline and diesel taxes, and potentially carbon taxes (depends on state).  It gets extreme and the EPA and BLM make it very expensive to deal\nwith the more stupid of the environmental concerns., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Na, we trained in the actual energy industry went through a rotational program for 5+ years of many specializations.  But, keep going.  Making me laugh more knowing that you teach in the 8th grade, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Phd 😘, @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Yea, this is not even close on the geothermal energy.  The vast majority, if not all, of geothermal requires drilling costs or borehole costs, the CAPEX being paid by the government, aka, the taxpayer.  Try again, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt So, because I worked hard (and made good choices), didn’t knock some girl up or become a criminal, I’m somehow selfish for what I make and what I believe others should attempt to contribute?  You’re pathetic, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Nope.  From a tiny town in BFE with a drunk father and a mother who needed constant help.  Had to work my way through high school and college just to\nget by., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Yup.  I’ve authored 29 of them.  But, keep going., @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt I did work for Baker Hughes until about 4 years ago.  I am an engineer on highly complex energy appraisals now.  Background is chemical engineering, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Well, why are you asking if you are so good at the subject?, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Do you have the education or relevant experience to lecture others on the matter?  No, comrade, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt A random publication from 2008, citing sources from 2002 and before, by Families USA, a nonprofit that has donated millions to democrats since the 80s is realllll trustworthy…laughable., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Reading must not be your strong suit…, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt You know how I know your “Dual Masters” are pointless?  You randomly googling articles that back up anything you say.  You should give those degrees back., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Yet again, says the guy who supports an actual communist in Bernie.  Yes, he is a communist and was dumb enough to praise breadlines.  Zero credibility.  Next 😘, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Awwww, must’ve struck a nerve.  Says the guy who supports Bernie with his 3-4 houses and millions of dollars paying less than 20% in taxes.  Pathetic, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Needed a last laugh.  Says the guy with NO expertise in climate, geology, chemical or geological engineering.  Zero credibility.  Night night, comrade.  😘, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Sure.  Highly doubt significant contribution to society., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Wow, I guess numbers don’t count?, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Whatever you say, champ.  I can see you’re irritated.  Maybe you need a nap.  Zero…credibility…next, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt And how many of those 30+ democracies does the US fund military, or cover their associated costs for NATO?, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Comparing yourself to the Wright Brothers is the funniest thing I’ve seen today.  You one upped yourself in about 20 minutes!!!, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Do you teach that too?  Maybe you can show me how you like to diddle little boys in your classroom., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt You should go see Dr Rand Paul, comrade. https://t.co/5STpFtJCk5, @TheViashino @DeviousKindly @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Basically, he tweets after I go to bed and in the middle of his classes after I have stopped.  Kinda sad really., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Well educated?  Hahahahhahaha, in inflation adjusted dollars, the US has spent over 260% more per child on education since the 60s and yet the standard of education has lowered dramatically.  Try again, commie, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Wow, you’re still going?  Still no credibility.  Next, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt I’ve paid more taxes than what you’ll make in life, Lenin.  My net contribution is above Zero…maybe try to get out of the negative area before you start twiddling with calling others who fund your BS with their taxes commies, @markcojuangco @DeviousKindly @simonwakter @alex_avoigt For instance, the Lesser Prairie chicken in New Mexico cost my former company in excess of $1M in capital costs on a medium size drilling pad (4-6 wells).  The average cost of drilling and completing those wells were $7.5M/well.  And it’s for “building the bird a habitat”., @markcojuangco @DeviousKindly @simonwakter @alex_avoigt I don’t know the specifics of nuclear, but the net paid taxes alone in hydrocarbon production and refining are pretty high, from a reservoir engineering standpoint.  For instance, severance tax (5-7%/BOE), Corp income tax, property taxes for minerals (2% in Texas), etc., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt An 8th grade science teacher is as reliable in the area of geochemistry and geophysics as a used car salesman attempting to perform surgery…pathetic.  Maybe get some experience reading well logs or core samples, comrade.  Who knows, you could teach at the Gulags!!!, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Yes.  Says the guy who got more than 1 masters and is an 8TH GRADE SCIENCE TEACHER zzzzmammanfhdjomglol.  You seriously just made my day and I’m now happy to add another commie to the intelligentsia list.  Have a good Spring semester, comrade 😂😂😂, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt My God, just learned you are a Bernie supporter.  And you somehow deny being a Commie.  Wow.  Irony at its finest hour.  😂, @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @TheViashino @dtopley1 @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Middle school teachers don’t stay up on Twitter until 3:45am.  Do you even work?, @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt My sister has 2 masters and she doesn’t make much.  So, there’s that., @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt It’s not my assessment.  It’s the EIA’s on nuclear.  The wind and solar come from my career in assessing complex energy resources and their value under ad valor em purposes.  We don’t do nuclear.  Just wind, solar, hydrocarbons, geothermal and tidal., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt 8TH GRADE SCIENCE TEACHER!!!!!  Zzzzomg hahahahahahahaha, Zero credibility.  Thought I was at least debating actual science skill.  MMA?  Sure you do, laughable., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Soviet apologists don’t get a say anymore, champ., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt You really sound like you’re “B-word” fat.  Maybe get off Twitter, run a few miles, clean up your diet, get a new job, and quit living off of the 50% of the country that does pay net taxes before you start telling others what to do.  Thanks, Commie, @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Pretty sure the Third Reich was a Socialist party, champ.  Also, the commies murdered wayyyyy more people even than the evil Nazis.  Maybe learn some basic history, or your own ideology will stick you know in the cold, cold gulags with the rest of the intelligentsia., @BasedOmnisiah @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt I wouldn’t argue with this guy.  He’s a looney “vote dem no matter if they are actual communists” kind of guy., @DeviousKindly @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt That’s true.  However, then the information that you posted doesn’t coincide with the EIA in any applicable way.  Also, the report you presented does not include applicable disposal costs for solar, wind, or geothermal.  Which makes up the majority of OPEX for the major sources., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt Says the guy who thinks that science is made by a show of hands., @DeviousKindly @BasedOmnisiah @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt The entire point is that you believe that having others be forced to pay for others healthcare will solve this issue.  That’s the entire point being made., @DeviousKindly @TheViashino @dtopley1 @markcojuangco @simonwakter @alex_avoigt My god this is the saddest thing I’ve heard today.  \n\nAt lunch, do you make the kids get in breadlines and work them in the labor camps too?

I care about ~, @TheBurningSoul_ ~and sent a quick text, still grinning., @TheBurningSoul_ "As you like, kitten. Go shower, I'll make something up." He turned and went into the kitchen, lifting pans and ingredients, @TheBurningSoul_ He grinned. "I don't mind, kitten. Whatever you want is fine." He glanced back at him from his phone. "Do you still want ~, @TheBurningSoul_ He smiled against his lips, pulling him closer as he kissed him, @TheBurningSoul_ "I did. Did you?" He reached up, stroking his cheek.

And then you were placed in a position where you lost everything, even your own will. Did you ~, @TheBurningSoul_ He did so, gripping his hair and pulling. "As you like, kitten." He used that tug to move his head to the side, trailing ~, @TheBurningSoul_ He chuckled as he watched him. "Missing me already, kitten?" He teased, glancing at his laptop, @TheBurningSoul_ "Was I unclear? Get out."

And he left, going up the stairs to fetch the parcel., @TheBurningSoul_ ~stroking his hair with a gentle tone, @TheBurningSoul_ He smiled, reaching out to stroke his cheek. "Of course, kitten."

Then continue to frame in terms of mutual interlocking responsibilities., @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood "It's all in the books, if you care to get into the details" - possibly, if/when I can. (It's not my main field: I'm more focussed on creating useful tools for contexts of extreme change - the rights-discourse (rules etc) is an unhelpful irrelevance in those 'no-rules' contexts., @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "You keep using that word" - oh no, not 'The Princess Bride'? :-) I come from a systems-background (hard-systems, soft-systems, complex-systems et al).

In which case, respond accordingly to that lack/avoidance of 'response-ability' (e.g. as a 'crime', in social terms)., @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress The responsibilities of _everyone_ in the context. Otherwise we end up with victim-games, scapegoating, and all manner of other 'messes' - along with a societal inability to learn how to deal with complex contexts and exceptions to arbitrarily-presumed 'rules'., @PabloRedux @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @sd_marlow @Slate @JohnAFlood It's a useful-fiction for _one_ purpose only: identifying desired-outcomes. For _everything else_ it's a goddamn nuisance.

Answer: it is _your responsibility_ to find a way the resolve the dilemma. _NOT_ to impose on others (otherwise known as abuse - 'evasion of responsibility' - or violence - 'propping Self up by putting Other down')., @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress Paresh, we can quibble all we like about fine-details. All I'm saying is this: whenever you come across a concept of 'rights', ask yourself how that outcome can be achieved. Look closely at the responsibilities needed, by whom; and mutualities and interlocks to make it fair., @sd_marlow @EmergTechEthics @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood "Current levels of accountability have already failed" - of course they've failed. That's because they're trying to kludge together a new framework from a model whose core concept doesn't work in the first place. See e.g. my post on 'no rights' at https://t.co/wvanipOimE, @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood I've seen the discussions on 'natural rights' etc: to me they're garbage. Instead, think of 'rights' _solely_ as abstract declarations of desired-outcomes: _everything else_ (inc. accountability, liability etc) comes back _in practice_ to mutual, interlocking responsibilities., @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress If there is "no legal solution"? - then it's our _collective_ responsibility to fix the goddamn law, isn't it?

Don't duck that responsibility!_ :-), @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress Thank - a lot of people refuse to respect this part of my work at all, so I really do appreciate what you say there., @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress Yeah - "the face of the Other" is a good place to start. But then take the definition of 'the Other' to extremes: a flower as Other, a rock as Other, someone living a thousand or million years from now, or a thousand years ago; a line of code; or a robot, of course. Keep going!, @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress None of what I've said will make sense until/unless you drop the assumption that rights are somehow 'real' - rather than merely a useful-fiction'. Trying to force-fit what I've said about responsibilities into a 'rights-centric' frame would literally be a 'non-sense'... 1/2, @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress ...The core requirement is an understanding of the context, and of the mutualities and interlocks of response-types and 'response-abilities' that are need to achieve the desired outcome in the context., @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress ...that leads to framing-errors such as "You're talking about... eye for an eye".

(Rights-discourse invariably leads to "_I_ have 'rights', _you_ have responsibilities...) E.g. in childbirth, _support_ mother to decide!, @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "obligation to another form of life" - yep, it's a mess. Literally, in the Ackoff sense. _So treat it as one_. Don't make the mistake of 'drawing the line', when even the notion of 'the line' is inherently-problematic in that type of context?, @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood "Sounds like a case for Interest Theory [vs] Will Theory" - uh, I'm kinda more concerned about Practice than Theory? :-) :-) - hence the focus on the _practical_ outcomes from 'response-abilities' etc, @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "Yes, laws &amp;amp;rights r limited hence our dialogue" - yep, that's the starting-point. Now apply Ackoff-type reasoning about 'messes'/wicked-problems etc; add in a large chunk of Quaker-type practice on 'mess'-related conflict-resolution etc. Then keep going from there., @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "Define rights-discourse?" - any attempt to describe social and other interactions in terms of 'rights' possessed by Self over Other - particularly where mutualities and interlocks of responsibilities to implement 'rights' are glossed-over, ignored or assigned only to the Other., @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress A quick thank-you to all of you in this conversation last night - a great stream of insights for me early this morning. Will write up and post here when I can. (Example, 'free speech' is not a right, but a _responsibility_ on the individual to speak their truth), @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "Twitter isn't set up for this kind of thing" - yeah, I know. Twitter tends to drive towards simplistic assumptions and 'solutions' - exactly what this is _not_ about. It's complex; it's 'messy'; might be useful to start from there, rather than impose simplistic ideas of 'right'?, @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "But everyone has human rights?" - nope. It's a nice idea, but it doesn't work - _literally 'doesn't work', in the sense of actually doing anything. I've researched/written a lot on this, mainly for business-contexts, but see eg. post 'A post-rights era?', https://t.co/BYyUdGwPQx, @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress 'Right' as 'privilege, claim, immunity' etc is in essence a self-centric demand to _avoid_ mutuality of responsibilities - i.e. an assertion that only the Other has responsibilities. Consider _very_ carefully the implications of such an assertion: that's why to dump 'rights'., @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood I know that a responsibilities-discourse is not a popular one, but in real-world _practice_, the standard rights-discourse is a classic example of the old adage that "for each complex problem there is least one answer that is clear, simple, easy to understand, and wrong"., @PabloRedux @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @sd_marlow @Slate @JohnAFlood I _don't_ dispute that 'rights' can be a useful fiction: i.e. 'description of a desired outcome'.

Focus on 'response-abilities' instead.), @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood "If you do not find 'rights discourse' to be useful..." - it's more that I find it to be _actively_ harmful - and _invariably_ so whenever I have to deal with a real-world 'mess' (in the Ackoff sense - i.e. wicked-problem/wild-problem). Too simplistic to work in the real world., @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "You must be sick of me by now" :-) - no, not at all (though I _must_ get other work done before I go to bed tonight...)

Yet I find it always useful to go back to first-principles on anything. And to me, first-principles in this context are: "what is the desired outcome?"; "what is socially 'fair'?" and "how do we get there?", @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood Literally 'response-abilities': the ability to choose and enact responses that are appropriate to the overall context. In a social context, what are the meshwork of 'response-abilities that will lead to a desired outcome (the purported 'right')., @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress Courts etc: these help to provide guidelines for default decisions etc - but when things get messy (e.g. medical-ethics dilemmas), it ultimately _must_ come back to those involved. (I'm deriving a lot of this from Quaker decision-making, btw.), @EmergTechEthics @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "Nietzsche... Wittgenstein..." - uh, I is only a Bear Of Little Brain, I gave up on mainstream philosophy almost half a century ago... :-( :-) (FWIW, if philosophy is the label to be used, I like Pirsig's concept of 'sophism' in 'ZAMM' - though not his later concepts of 'value'), @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress Who decides in a conflict? Bring it back to this: What are the required responses with the context? Who/what has the ability to deliver those responses? What are the mutualities? What are the interlocks that make it 'fair' all round? Then _collectively_ decide., @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress ...Real example: 'right to life' versus 'right to choose'. It's impossible to resolve via a rights-discourse. Instead, what are desired outcomes? What are the 'response-abilities' in that context (e.g. only the mother can give birth), and their societal mutualities / interlocks., @PKathrani @EmergTechEthics @David_Gunkel @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood No. Dump the concept of 'rights': it doesn't work in any valid way, other than as a declaration of a desired outcome. Each so-called 'right' is implementable solely via a meshwork of mutual, interlocking responsibilities - focus there, not on the misleading concept of 'rights'., @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood "though in that world, robots, dogs, and humans would be on equal footing" - why not? Seriously: _why not?_ What on earth gives us the right (yep, that word again) to assume that we have the right (that word again) to assign ourselves priority over everything else? Hmm???, @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood I'm going to be blunt: I don't give a damn what a purported 'authority-figure' wrote about this. I have a response-ability to work out how this works; so do you. In which case, why rely solely on someone else's word? - wouldn't that be an evasion of responsibility on your part?, @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "And isn’t the argument that you’re putting forward the right of the mother in all but name?" - nope. I'm arguing that the mother is _necessarily_ _central_ in this, because she alone has certain 'response-abilities' - but that's not the same as any notion of 'right'., @EmergTechEthics @David_Gunkel @PKathrani @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood No - robots (and robot-makers) need clarity on responsibilities, and the respective mutualities and interlocks of those responsibilities. _The same applies to humans too_ - the entire 'rights-discourse' is an irrelevant aberration focussed on _avoidance_ of responsibilities., @sd_marlow @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress "is not the same as entitlements" - oh yeah. Oh boy.: 'entitlements' is yet another whole mess of a 'mess'. Don't get me started on that one (especially as I _really_ need to get to bed now, if I'm to get any work done in the morning! :-) ), @PKathrani @David_Gunkel @EmergTechEthics @sd_marlow @PabloRedux @Slate @JohnAFlood @mitpress Agreed that 'rights' do work, up to a point. It's like how Newtonian physics works well for the mid-range; but if you take it to either extreme (quantum-level to cosmology), it falls apart / is unreliable etc. And most 'rights' challenges are at the extremes, not in the middle...]</td>

      <td>[@TomFenwick2 Yep, 50-22 would stay as it is. As for the penalty, you could either quick tap, set tap move, spiral bomb, general phase play or take the three. Plenty of variety., @rugby_fan The water breaks are ridiculous, as I said at the time. The old system was absolutely fine. They just pandered to some vocal media pundits who never understood how it worked. Caterpillar covered by existing laws. Just needs proper ‘use it’ and strict 5 count., @h_dundon @oxfordcleaver Yep but at the moment it’s too heavily weighted towards the attack., @BourneBen79 Teams will need to find different ways to score tries. I can live with that., @BourneBen79 Exactly, ambitious broken-field running rather than conservative belting it downfield. Coaching and tactics also much more ambitious., @lewiswilling I don’t mind the occasional one, but the current deluge is a bit much., @BourneBen79 You think? I reckon there’s been much more adventurous play without relegation from the teams near the bottom., @RuckinRugby Not for me, but always interesting to hear new ideas., @sidneyref That would be a start, yes!, @RPBlackburn Exactly, so not all would be kicked. More variety., @rodmac007 We all love a wall! 😂, @therealdoc79 Or they could go for a quick tap, a set tap move, a spiral bomb, a scrum. More variety., @BourneBen79 I’d strongly disagree, Falcons for example playing much more rugby and scoring from deep rather than the risk-averse kick-chase which relegation so often brings., @NevsLeftBoot @RugbyInsideLine I don’t know the answer but it’d be interesting to see what % of pens from 30m or closer are kicked to touch, and how many of those result in maul tries. As I say, I don’t know, but intuitively it feels like too many., @paulmizen1 @TaftRugby Yep, I’m all for players not knocking on and conceding scrum pens, too., @GEPC No problem, and likewise., @sbell_15 Or quick tap, or set tap move, or spiral bomb, or phase play. Variety., @Celtic334 True. Interesting discussion point., @Dr_Rugby13 I don’t mind the odd one, but not when it’s SO dominant as a tactic., @Guy_Griffiths You’d be getting subs every two minutes while they rotate who’s getting a rest. Not the answer for me., @RFWilding Worse than chocolate pizza!? 🤔😂, @TomFenwick2 Not at all, just after a bit more variety rather than kick-lineout-maul-try every time there's a penalty within 35 metres of the line., @TimPercival 🥰, @peter_drinnan Attackers would need to show creativity and variety to score tries, which is no bad thing., @Celtic334 Hmm maybe. I’d just rather see penalties not continually kicked to the corner, and bypass the whole thing. Just an idea, haven’t fully thought it through yet., @ianperkins69 😂 we get our fair share too!, @oxfordcleaver Not infringing of course is also helpful, but if we’re striving to attract new fans to the sport I don’t personally think the answer is to feed them a diet of predictable maul tries. Let’s have some more variety in attack., @aapierre I’ve seen plenty of them Aidan. Good and bad refs there, as at every level., @RugbyInsideLine It’s just an idea. I don’t think there’s a perfect answer but when I see a penalty given 30m out I go and pop the kettle on cos I know what’ coming. If it’s turning me off as a hardcore rugby fan, what must it be doing for newbies?, @RPBlackburn @JerryHiggins86 Kickers these days if they’re any good can have a decent % from wide out. And if they don’t fancy it they can tap, scrum, spiral bomb etc., @Hartleyno9 @SharkTankRugby But let’s at least attempt to. People are turning away from the sport., @Timnelmes1 Not ALL the time. Just trying to encourage some variety., @BluewaterFp Or 22 😉, @GEPC The mauling is now so predictable it’s turning people off. Let’s have some more taps, bombs, phase play etc., @aapierre Always careful not to generalise with refs, they change so much from week to week., @LooseheadG I’d just do it in the 22, but interesting debate., @SharkTankRugby That’s one compromise I guess, but do we then lose the scrum five?, @AndyD83 I’m still baffled why more teams don’t take the 3, but the maul is so stacked in their favour I guess it’s irresistible., @JacCooper1 Just thinking of ways to have more variety rather than dull predictability., @spkeene I’d be in favour of that but I recall the reason they binned that law trial was medical concern over dropped mauls, so it’s not realistic. I’m 100% with you though. I thought that law trial was great. Good mauling teams could still profit from it but there was more variety., @epaez11 Exactly, it’s stacked too heavily in favour of that and I think we should tip the balance to create more uncertainty., @Willo79 A scrum 30m out instead of a lineout 5m out. Should open up the field for some good attacking rugby., @RichardPOliver Feels like the maul laws are already complicated enough. I just want to see fewer of them and more variety., @rodmac007 Probably, and some more quick taps. Hopefully some set tap moves. Bring back ‘the wall!’, @aussiedub Wrong thread!? 🤷‍♂️😂, @andrewjtracey I do enjoy league, also like union. Just love a bit more variety rather than penalty-maul-try., @John90426214 You make a compelling argument. You’ve won me over., @jhatter13 Feels like another layer of complication to me., @oxfordcleaver More quick taps, let’s have some set tap moves. Bring back ‘the wall’. Love it!, @WooksAmesbury Anything to bring more variety. It’s just a turn-off for many when it’s so predictable., @Steven_D_Rogers And every hooker in the world! 😂, @RPBlackburn @JerryHiggins86 I’d keep the 50-22 as it is., @RugbyInsideLine Yeah, point taken. I guess we just want more variety, not a binary ‘points or maul’ choice. I’m not saying I’ve found the answer, either! Just thinking out loud., @PeterScott1973 Well, that’s a start of course., @TheRugbyGuy6 @RugbyInsideLine Not sure how much difference that would make and hard for the refs to count mid-maul. Get rid of the penaltouche in the 22 and knock it on the head properly., @dicko120 The odd one is fine but it’s taking over games., @SelwayIaine A well-constructed rebuttal 😂, @frenchie1985 I don’t mind the odd one but there are way too many, they’re taking over lots of games and it’s a big turn-off for lots of us., @LeaHedges That would be a welcome start., @brainwash_north Any kick which goes into touch in the 22., @A_D_Jones It’s all about opinions. No right and wrong with these things., @Guy_Griffiths So any injuries after that and you’re down to 14? I see your intention but just not sure it’d work in practice., @boney75 True re refs. I’m not saying remove it altogether. Just mitigate the absolute tide we’re seeing atm., @aussiedub That’s one school of thought. I just know that I and many others find it a major turn-off., @simongriifinjp Ha, like it!, @n36shorty I see merit but think teams would just milk a tap., @wherrys Think conceding 3 would still be a disincentive, or bring have more quick taps or set tap moves. Anything for some variety., @NickRayment That was allowed for one season as a trial but medical concerns meant it wasn’t taken on., @RugbyTimes I’m open to suggestions on the detail. Could obvs kick at goal., @16th_man Reffing the current laws would certainly be a start., @Gray147 I’m not saying it’s a binary choice: maul or kick at goal. Let’d see some more variety. Quick taps, wall moves for example., @aapierre 100%, @JackA17B Interesting view, although the lottery of scrum pens could start deciding games., @ConorMurphy90 You make a compelling argument 🤔., @oxfordcleaver Ha, class! 😂, @mandycassidy65 @Steven_D_Rogers If it spreads out the tries, then great., @sbell_15 The idea being that they wouldn't kick for touch so there'd be no line-out. Can still quick tap, run a set penalty move, put the spiral bomb up or take the 3. More variety., @KieranStanworth @Celtic334 Well, we all have our differing opinions, and that’s great., @Guy_Griffiths Anything but rolling subs. We need more fatigue, not less., @epaez11 Hmm think that would just encourage defenders to commit more of those offences maybe., @felix_meller Well done to them, the exception that proves the rule perhaps., @ChrisScaacs There’s no perfect answer. I’ll take the least bad to avoid the tide of mail tries., @TomFenwick2 Yep, if you’re in your own half., @John90426214 Happy for it to be an element. Just not THE element., @IgtIan Yep, that’s a valid point., @NickRayment To be fair I don’t think World Rugby are ‘happy’ with Retallick’s clearance. He got a straight red and will presumably be banned., @GEPC The odd one is fine, but we're seeing the same thing all too often and it's a turn-off for a lot of people., @GEPC Doing a 50-22 is a great bit of skill and pretty rare in games, so I can live with a few mauls as part of the mix. All about having that variety. Not just maul, maul and more maul., @John90426214 I’d just like more variety in the game rather than a tide of predictable maul tries. If it’s turning me off as a hardened fan, what must it be doing to newbies?, @Hartleyno9 @SharkTankRugby Exactly, your reward for nearly scoring is getting the ball back 45 metres out. Great!, @BourneBen79 Not really much I can say after a defeat. Any comment will be jumped on or picked apart so I tend to just keep quiet., @KieranStanworth @Celtic334 Could always quick tap, set tap move, spiral bomb, scrum or take 3. More variety., @RogerWill5458 Feels like more stoppages and complications to me., @spen219 That’s fine, if you’re satisfied that the game in its current state can draw in enough new viewers to make it work., @alaninrepose @WooksAmesbury I think the existing laws can thwart it if applied properly. Early ‘use it’ call and strictly police the 5 seconds., @hamesy54 Yep, I see some merit in that., @GEPC The game is ever evolving, yes., @epaez11 Teams could still score tries, just need to work a bit harder and show more variety., @sbell_15 That would mean more maul tries, not less., @GEPC I’d just like some more variety., ...]</td>

- wasn’t rugby was in a transition period going from amateur to professional that’s a different era, @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Its just a theory the great club grounds have dilapidated since the regions came into force - the bones are still there \n\nThose facilities could not only be used for rugby but for the community and other uses to help generate revenue which is sadly lacking at present, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys More likely English ones - will be surprised if they allow Welsh clubs in, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Thanks for clarifying this Christ! the clubs are poorer and others will gain from potential sale of grounds 😞, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Chances of that happening is very unlikely las the English are now more protective of their own league, @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Wow you are looking at the end product straight away 👀👀 \n\nIf it was a franchise league first five years would be used to allow it to grow \n\nUtilise the current facilities and improve them long term step by step \n\nRather than everything coming in place short term - not possible, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Agree with that and coming from England it will be very very tough to get 2 Welsh sides in a revamped English Premiership it’s almost closed door, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys From the responses I have had I can comfortably say that it is a high percentage in Wales say that 8 pro teams is not feasible\n\nHowever most fans would prefer to have 8 teams and more professional games in Wales - the probability of it happening is very close to nil, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Yes and more Japanese professional players that will strengthen Japan national team, @RugbyPhilBB @Drama21Jonny @Wilttwits @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys The outcome is I found out more especially from Phil and the situation in Wales club rugby is worse than I thought it was and most agree that URC is a disaster for Welsh rugby and 4 regions is best at the moment its how it will move forward, @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Giving franchise owners more of a free rein to develop and run their own facilities could surprise us what they do - this has not been tried and tested, @Wilttwits @simonrug @fforest31 It was hypothetical and the responses I have got back were negative and more money related 🙄🙄 it’s more obvious now that Welsh rugby is in rather sorry state and future doesn’t look bright, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys You too even if we got off a rough start 😂 still have a pint with you anytime have a good week, @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys You would be looking at £30million or so nowadays to build another parc y scarlets - that’s down to franchise owner to do so \n\nor they update the current facilities to a standard set by the ‘new league’ \n\n30sqm toilet facility would be north £50k \n\nA small hospitality area £100k, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Covid and climate change will be bigger factors in future meaning more games abroad will likely to be called off - loss of revenue this could be like this over the next 5 or 10 years \n\nWas suggesting to keep it local, use what we already have and build on it, @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys A lot cheaper to update Neath, Pontypool Bridgend and Newport grounds \n\nParc y scarlets £30m is stadium inc parking area, infrastructure and new roads however the others already have it there grounds just need to improve \n\nAlso set the ideal capacity at min 7500, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys I didn’t propose going back to clubs but franchises which is different \n\nCan you give an example of an idea proposed recently for Welsh club rugby that you thought was good, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys I think that’s potential suicide for the Welsh pro teams and will end up leading to ending up with two teams it happened in Scotland where Edinburgh and Glasgow had the bigger financial muscle which killed off Borders and Caledonia pro teams \n\nIt is rather risky though, @onedeanbeirne @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys True and if the restrictions were lifted off like WRU involvement in the pro game wasn’t there almost a breakaway a while ago? \n\nI guess we just have to hope that there will be a Welsh Kerry Packer one day, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys I am referring to recent responses in regards to ideas/proposals you did mention 2+2 and I read up that a two tier system - that’s a walking disaster to me and more likely to end up with 2 pro teams - again that’s just my view yours may be different, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Look it was hypothetical and the responses I have had involves around money rather than different vision or ideas  I was hoping to see from people Not such negativity \n\nThe old grounds still have the bones there and franchises would have given them the opportunity to rise again, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys I am more frustrated now 😂😂 knowing a bit more about the situation now, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys I am now finding more about the current situation in Welsh Club rugby + how other countries are doing it would not surprise me in five years time or so that it will be 2 pro teams in Wales + more Welsh ints playing abroad due to bigger financial incentives + 60 cap rule scrapped, @Wilttwits @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys I have moved on 😎 we are all entitled to an opinion, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Thank you 👍🏻, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Most responses have said URC is a disaster - what would be the alternatives if or then it falls apart, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Also appreciate the other responses and views put forward to me though it was like daggers pointing at me from lots of angles\n\nI rather have your views that just relying on the media - I do read a lot on Wales online rugby for stories in wales from the outside  \n\nDiolch yn fawr, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys SRU really couldn’t afford to run 4 teams that’s why they went down to 2 + Caledonia merged with Glasgow + Borders with Edinburgh who were then called Edinburgh Reivers \n\nI had a mate who played for Caledonia and watched a few of their games in the late 1990s at St Johnstone FC, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys If I was a young Welsh professional/international player I would be unsure about playing in wales in near future as there is a lot of uncertainty going on and would be looking at playing abroad if it was purely financial - like Cory Hill and Jake Ball, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Most are not happy with URC what do we do if we leave it? I have not seen other suggestions \n\n8 teams could be a temporary measure if not franchises. NZ had their own super tournament in 2020 with 5 teams lacked more variety and fixtures IMO, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys British superleague I would envisage that would more likely to be a franchise system and league/clubs no connection to the unions, @simonrug @fforest31 You might think it’s unworkable - I think it’s workable and brings back rivalries/support groups do I really want to watch Dragons vs Zebre no I would prefer to watch Pontypool vs Cardiff at a packed Pontypool Park if there was 8 franchises at the top @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys The game is growing in USA + Japan as they do have the huge financial power or access to investor money \n\nJapan have recently changed their system how their pro teams are controlled and players paid split their top division into two conferences in a new three tier system league, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys The other assessment is that iconic old club grounds are rather dilapidated and it will cost more to update them than initially thought as the requirements of being a pro rugby facility is higher today and most of these grounds do not have certain facilities to meet them, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys The clubs who own them probably likely get more money by selling ground for other development + build a new ground on the outskirts of their town or village \n\nIt’s not a outlook that I like to see as I like going to old style grounds who have more character + part of community, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Look I’m testing the waters no one else has come up with ideas/proposals - there is no perfect option having 8 teams just playing in Wales brings in more professional matches actually being played in Wales so the money stays in Wales allowing more chance to watch team live games, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Is WRU involvement in professional club rugby in Wales putting off potential big investors?  \n\nShould pro rugby in Wales use the English Prem model - no RFU? \n\nShould WRU follow the IRFU model putting more money in the pro system and also help pay for quality overseas players?, @simonrug @fforest31 Wouldn’t that make the number of professional players smaller - I know Simon doesn’t agree with me I still think 8 pro teams just playing in Wales is best way forward to build up depth - look at the stand by players Cardiff used they were great to watch especially the young ones, @GoetersFourTwo @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys WRU to develop and build a National Rugby training area/academy on par with Prem league teams - the Vale is coming to the end of its shelf life with full size indoor pitch which would allow the franchises to have smaller training facilities near their grounds/location, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys It’s about adapting to change historically WRU have been slow to do that as shown in the Slammed series which was a great insight of the best and worst of the Welsh teams of 1998-2008 - I went to lots of games in that era, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys They would have used the catchment areas as a financial indicator :) from experience large retail companies do this approach whether a potential site will bring a good return in investment - both teams seem to be going strong and stronger however the national team is different, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Have you looked up Major League rugby in the USA they use a franchise system + started with 6 or 7 teams 4 yrs ago + now there are 13 teams it’s growing fast it’s a model that works well in US + being a minor sport - $4m min for franchise could this work in Wales??, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys That’s a possibility, more teams would allow for unused professional players that each region have to play more games in a season in theory nothing is perfect each has pros + cons everyone has different opinions the only thing that’s has been tried and tested is 5 or 4 pro teams, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys The Amanda Blanc situation - it would be interesting to see what comes out of it and what proposals Amanda had put forward, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys https://t.co/h9dvyhOkA6 is this what you mean by 2+2 as a two tier system?, @simonrug @fforest31 Combine the Welsh Premiership and regions together into franchises of 8 pro teams playing each other and bring back the iconic grounds - you would get more ticket sales without doubt - play euro comps against other countries clubs - for me the Pro12/URC is a complete disaster, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys High wages in sport won’t last forever - look at Barcelona that state it is in massive debts and they will get bigger due to risks they are taking 👀👀 they can’t even afford the worlds best player \n\nSo you are saying there are no more ideas on how Welsh club rugby can improve?, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Phil it’s been great to see another view/perspective you do have a lot of knowledge of what’s going inside all Welsh rugby - If I were you I would be really frustrated with the current situation as it is still up in the clouds thank you for your time, @andylance1977 @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys WRU seem to be investing in property especially with the new Hotel in Cardiff 👀👀, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Money aside most fans would prefer to see more professional games in Wales though, @RugbyPhilBB @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Have a look at Wikipedia re Japanese clubs https://t.co/hVkQ79sVt3, @555Husker @jpstafford @simonrug @fforest31 @PontypoolRFC @BenJeffreys Well it will happen more often in future with different sports  - there aren’t many top pro golf events in the UK as prize money has gone through the roof that players follow where the money is gone like the Middle East, China and the USA]</td>

It's considerably bigger., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras The universe is currently best explained by universal laws. If that turns out to be false, scientists will happily reject their theory, and use a better one which explains the universe better. That's what science is - a self-correcting process, not a body of knowledge., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Smith-Mundt is irrelevant to me as I'm not an American. I'm truly sorry that you appear to live in such a cesspit of distrust, confusion of fairy stories with reality,  and paranoia. It must make living happily very hard for you., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Oh gross.... those poor customers.\n\nSo you think water is a universal solvent do you? I see....\n\nDo you know what pusillanimous actually means?, @BillyZigouras @darnitcomics @iamericmichael @michael22300807 All good scientists question their own findings. It's called "doing science"., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras The theory of evolution is (being a theory) theoretical. It is scientific. The germ theory of disease is (being a theory) theoretical. It is scientific. You're confusing the word "theoretical" with "hypothetical" again - but hypotheses are also scientific!, @iamericmichael @BillyZigouras @darnitcomics @michael22300807 You literally said yesterday that you work in food delivery, and wash your hands only with water after cleaning your anus., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Those are the Euclidean axioms 3/2, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Yes, we're just lucky. The evidence that the moon used to be closer is straightforward, and we can directly measure it moving away from us now. The fact you find this funny (if in fact you do) really just reflects your lack of a decent science education, which I genuinely lament., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @LaunchAlligator @darnitcomics @BillyZigouras "As it would appear on a flat plane"....hoist by your own petard....again., @michael22300807 @iamericmichael @BillyZigouras Interestingly, he's a professional urologist. Not an experimental scientist at all., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Not really. Euclid was around in the 3rd century BC., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras You simply keep asking new questions in response to my requests for clarifications. That's what "moving the goalposts" means.\n\nIn answer to your new question: yes I do, but as I have said, hypotheses are never "proven", only supported or disproven. Look up "falsifiability"., @iamericmichael @EricFaceplant @BillyZigouras @michael22300807 @darnitcomics Thing is, your employer is examining your posts about your personal hygiene., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras I'm just asking for clarification before I answer., @EricFaceplant @iamericmichael @BillyZigouras @michael22300807 @darnitcomics It rhymes with "because Eric is a total doron"., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Incidentally, astronomy isn't really an experimental science anyway - it's an observational one., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras In case of failure to understand, please re-read. You do know what an axiom is?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras I have, as have many people who have had the vaccine. That doesn't mean it is ineffective. There's clear evidence that vaccinated people are less likely to suffer severe symptoms if infected., @Questionwhatuf1 @Maksimu22 @BillyZigouras Don't be offensive, please., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @LaunchAlligator @darnitcomics @BillyZigouras How do you know your eyes are real?, @michael22300807 @iamericmichael @BillyZigouras I heard this conspiracy theory that the amazing things you see on ST are actually camera trickery and CGI., @michael22300807 @iamericmichael @BillyZigouras "NASA, WEF, Illuminati, gibber, slobber, drool....", @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Oh dear. Would you agree that scientists all around the globe have secured similar sequencing results?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Eric Michael I think you should "embrace the mystery" of how you manage to type and breathe at the same time., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Anyway back to the point. I don't "take people's word for it" that the Earth is a globe. I observe it myself. It's very simple., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras "I was cleverer enough". If it wasn't a typo, you're just demonstrating your poor education., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Do you actually *mean* "independent variables"? Or are you actually referring to "universal constants"? Again, just for clarity,  as you appear to keep shifting the goalposts., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Ooops! "Speed" not "shoes", obviously! I was clearly trying to type at the speed of light....., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras I'm afraid your question has broken my vagueness-o-meter...., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras 1) not comedy - it's simply the scientific method. It's fundamentally misunderstood by most people. \n2) yes\n3) strictly, in science, you don't prove anything, as I've explained. By grasping that, yes, our understanding is limited, you progress, incrementally. 1/2, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras So if set off from different places on a flat earth, on parallel lines, we would meet?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Would you be willing to have a solution containing HIV injected into your arm to prove your confidence that HIV didn't cause AIDS? Seriously., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras I'm not a scientist., @iamericmichael @darnitcomics @BillyZigouras @michael22300807 You utter nobcheese. Again you avoid my point and then start drooling about Tesla-blah-blah. How many GMOs/processed foods/big pharma products were there in the 1340s? Which environmental toxins do you think caused plague? Oh yes! Y. pestis!, @darnitcomics @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras The good news is that Eric did switch his position on the flat earth yesterday, having accepted that "scientists all around the globe" agree on COVID, even if he himself doesn't., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras You are lost in a maelstrom of information, clutching at that which seems most immediately attractive, without discernment, without moorings., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras YES! A HUGE WIN! You have agreed that *SCIENTISTS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE* agree! Flat Earth hypothesis SMACKDOWN! Lol, @BobbyFonz @realTimTrimble @USlawreview @BillyZigouras @HumbleSeeker2 I don't think he attacked you for being a homosexual, to be fair., @darnitcomics @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras All scientists "all around the globe", remember, Eric...., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Ah! Paradigms! Good! It does appear we have different paradigmatic views, yes. Do you or do you not think the universe is rationally comprehensible?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras You DON'T just make wild leaps like "the Earth is flat" or "barium suppresses rainfall" and expect to taken seriously without extraordinarily good evidence. 2/2, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras All right, identical., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Said the person who thought the Earth's shadow was tiny compared to the Moon, and confused a lunar with a solar eclipse.... you're so right. You do know that "common sense" explanations (i.e. those that "make most sense") are often wrong?, @iamericmichael @darnitcomics @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Because you're a contrarian, crayon-chewing cretin?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.\n\nIf equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n\nIf equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n\nThings which coincide with are equal to one another.\n\nThe whole is greater than the part. 2/2, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Dimwit. That's a SOLAR eclipse, then the moon moves in front of the sun. A lunar eclipse is when the moon passes through the Earth's (very large) shadow., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras You've gone quiet on this "deflection"....., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras And to include a typo of your own in your reply., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras If you *did* mean astrology, then the independent variable might be your subjects star signs.... you control did that variable by picking people from a wide range if stae signs. Then you measure a certain personality trait (the dependent variable), and see if it aligns., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Correct - all maths is built on certain basic axioms. We all agree on them and have built all maths (and science from there). 1/2, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras See my reply to your "lunar eclipse" idiocy. I am at least cleverer than you., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Yes, yes, (in the case of science) no, no, astronomy., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras I don't believe chronic fear and stress have any negative health impacts., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Not really. Your first two are correct in the mathematical/scientific sense of the word., @SpankyThree @BillyZigouras Do you know what a "full moon" is?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Why don't you tell me instead?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras No. You're deflecting again., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras A classic - change the subject when you start losing the argument., @michael22300807 @iamericmichael @LaunchAlligator @darnitcomics @BillyZigouras No this one will be in hi-def and part of continuous video. Oh sorry, I mean "CGI video", Eric., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras I didn't mention vaccines at all., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras So if we kept heading north, in your view, would we meet?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras But our topic of discussion is the shape of the Earth, not climate change., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras It's very cool, but your quoted "odds" are meaningless. It's like saying "what are the odds that the shoes of light is what it is?". It just IS that speed., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Pro tip: it doesn't., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Deflection., @EricFaceplant @iamericmichael @BillyZigouras @michael22300807 @darnitcomics Other Eric, Eric., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras So you're now saying, contrary to what I said, that I *don't* agree with a significant portion of what he says? And what "fundamental research" do you think the lecturer has done?, @iamericmichael @darnitcomics @BillyZigouras @michael22300807 So go on then. What causes, say, bubonic plague to spread? HAARP? Crystal vibrations? Chakras? Bigfoot?, @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Well done for avoiding US TV. Its rubbish. But I guess you watch YouTube instead, which is worse. Try reading books by people who are actually *qualified*., @BillyZigouras @iamericmichael @darnitcomics @michael22300807 That's called "an anecdote". My mother has had 3 jabs and has not been sick, while my cousin refused jabs and was in intensive care. Neither of those facts "proves" anything at the population scale., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras Also.... your personal habits sound completely gross. Please never work in a café or restaurant., @iamericmichael @michael22300807 @BillyZigouras But YOU brought up "pseudoscience" as a new topic. That's deflection., ...]</td>

Or did that not happen?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 "5, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I think they also give an assist if you win a free kick too and it's scored from., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 It's better than listening to twitter football., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Ah so now we are comparing a target man with a winger? Is that where we are going now?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Not sure what point you are trying to make? I've not said he should start every game or he is our best winger. Just that stats alone don't tell you all you need to know., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Ooooo another wrong fact., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I think that was you., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Are you basically saying he is like Danny was as a player?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Yes I do remember it., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 But if you are using these things in an argument you have to get them right otherwise the point is invalid. There are many things to take into consideration., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 You are exposed to all this football and yet in this thread you've got quite a few facts wrong., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Do you need help? He has 2 for Barcelona (3 if we take the stupid penalty assist) 3 last season and those 2 would have been the continued previous season. Not 2 in 2 years as you suggested., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 It's not up for debate that grealish is better. I've never said traore was better and never once put him in that kind of player bracket. You keep doing that., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Unfortunately no the evidence doesn't as it doesn't state that the reason that cross went to the keeper is because the defender handballed it. Barcelona got a penalty and scored from it., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 We will have to agree to disagree. Next player?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 No no. Just direct quotes. It's not the only one., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Do you want me to share the player of the month award you said he never won too?, @_Chris_Henry @DANIELLUCAS20 I just hope he never sees any of the messages where Danny reveals his true feelings., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I think if you look back I say he's a very frustrating player. If you put the tweets in where I say he's been good it shows he can be very good or very poor., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 You're a keeper 😚, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 He's also extremely useless against teams that in and allow no space. He's an extremely frustrating player and he's probably at a level he will never get above ability wise. The things he lacks are things that come naturally to people. It can't be coached., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 The incident in the 57th minute. Care to expand on it?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 And maybe Danny and woody will be allowed to use their phones., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I've thought of a fair way to settle this. Interested?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Not seen him play so couldn't comment sorry., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I mean I'm not sure where you are getting your information from. Last 5 league games are 4 wins and a draw. It's 5 if you include the fa cup but he started that. And the other wins apart from the Southampton game which he scored in we were drawing when he came on., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 When you say another, you mean his first of the season?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Unless he's grown since joining Newcastle? https://t.co/30qeYpamSU, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Not even a good morning. How rude. Correct. Is a football calendar done over a year? And correct 2 years ago is 2020. That would be February 2020 which was still the 2019/20 season. So unless you can provide evidence that all his assists were in 2019 your point is incorrect., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Yes but ait-nouri is going to be one of the best players in his position in the world., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Do you think a player should get an assist for a goal being scored from a corner?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 What about xg?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Anyway I want to know where the ferran Torres thing was going, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 🤣🤣 I think if someone read all these we'd be sharing a padded cell mate., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Too be fair though albrighton has been underrated most his career. Steady player., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 It went to var. That's why the goal is a couple of minutes after., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Traore has more assists in a single season and goals than albrighton who's had many more games than traore., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Torres also missed an open goal., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Yes with adamas assist, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 And wood was signed by Burnley for £15m the same year we signed traore for £18m. Newcastle just signed him for £25m and Barca will be paying £29m for traore., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Unfortunately I don't have time to sit and watch every game going. I watch wolves and England., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 *Dias, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 And it doesn't which manager or team it is. You stated it's never happened., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Out of our wide players over the same time period at the club adamas goal contribution is better than the others. In his last season jota only got 1 assists and 5 league goals., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 He won't say he's shit. He also doesn't have to say what he said. This was from last season., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 He's not., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 From a player you 'like' https://t.co/FFmTgR6ads, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Leeds talking about how to deal with him. Do you want me to show more? https://t.co/ymYiyCv3jH, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 You just did compare them. At least pick a player in the same position and we all know Newcastle will have to pay over the odds now for a player., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Tenner says he wins it, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 That semi good season he had the only players in front of him in the league were city and Liverpool players., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 That is true but watch him every week and you see more than that. Look at his stats for his 2nd season with us when he was a regular starter. The other seasons he's been in and out., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 So they had the same impact?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Not a bad debut for the unproductive Mr traore, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 What's that got to do with anything? 🤣, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 2 years ago is 2020. Which would include the 19/20 season. Plus he has 2 for Barcelona., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I've noticed you have an issue with a certain type of player., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 That ineffective that teams will put 2 or 3 on him or alter their tactics to stop us using him?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Until you watch him live I don't think you can appreciate how much he actually gets fouled and stopped. Also you need to take into consideration how defensively we've played and more often than not he has 1 player in the box surrounded by 3 defenders., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 If it was 4 years it would be 12 assists. Not sure why you are working in years as football is done in seasons which span 2 different years., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Adama assist again. Yesterday., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Sums him up https://t.co/pTTF28PPTB, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Before you ask as well. Yes. Yes I am going to every time., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 And yes he hasn't got enough assists or goals overall but you can't just simply say it's his fault. I think the Leicester game this season he set up 3 easy chances and all were missed. We've been consistently one of the lowest scorers in the league., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 My point is grealish won't fulfil his potential and price tag., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Is judge Adam like judge Judy?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 How's this one for you? In 10/15 years time we will look back and say grealish wasted his talent., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 There are worse than that. Remember the goal son scored where he ran from his own box and scored? The player who passed it to him got an assist. Even though son ran the whole length of the pitch after the pass., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Klopp disagrees https://t.co/Y9lm6MDOS8, @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I'm surprised at your view of him. Yes he's frustrating as hell but there is a reason pretty much every team we play alter their tactics specifically for him. To look at just his stats for an opinion is silly as he offers so much more than that., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I've said it a few times on here. He's a very up and down player. He can be brilliant one minute and awful the next. At no point have I claimed he's world class. He's no better or worse than the other wingers we have., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Yeah the league kinda stopped. Some major international crisis or something. Naughty for not getting assists while the league was suspended., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I've proved that. Unfortunately if this were in court I'd have won a long time ago. You've made numerous mistakes and sweeping statements I've proved incorrect. I've also provided evidence from experts in the field of association football of their opinion of his ability., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Thank you. You were meant to be proving that I said he was world class. There isn't anything there I haven't said in this thread., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I reckon we've got a podcast here between us. Me and you arguing while woody and Danny sit there not saying anything., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Do you realise how popular we are making Danny look? The amount of comments on his post. He will be classed as an influencer soon., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Don't know him. Is he ferrans brother?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Not sure who you are referring to?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 So one of the best managers in world football, if not the best, is basing his opinion on a player based on his performance against his team but that's not correct because it doesn't fit your narrative?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Which bit?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I'm too pissed off to even bring it up, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Why is he?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 What was your point about ferran Torres going to be anyway?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 But his first this season? You keep saying we can't look back at past seasons. So we have to judge it on now., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 If you can show me where I've said he's world class I'll concede. All I've ever said is that for me just looking at his stats doesn't tell the whole story of him as a player., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Nope. I'm saying Barcelona are set up to score goals and get more than player in the box which will drastically help a winger. If you look at our other wingers there is only hwang who's scored in the league this season now traore has left., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Also when klopp said this he wasn't answering a direct question about traore. He brought it up during a question about his own team., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 As I said only Liverpool and city players in front of him., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I'm not sure you do. What you'd lose credibility on would be not calling something how it is. When he's been poor I've called it and when he's been good I've called it., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 There are also plenty saying how well he's played. Imagine living in a world where you can only have one opinion on something., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I'm unsure where this struggling to get in the 11 comes from to. He started the most games out of all the wide players for wolves., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 I've watched him loads since he joined wolves and I can safely say I've seen him attempt to dribble passed players many many more times than I've seen him do what he did in your clip. Hence why he's always near the top of take ons and dribbles., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 We don't have any., @tomwood09 @nickandrew10 @DANIELLUCAS20 Well if you bothered joining in you'd have known I said that., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 https://t.co/vyaO1NBtyI, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Sorry I should say I do have the time but choose to do other things., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Successful take ons, chances created. Traore is top., @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 Would you like it in full context?, @nickandrew10 @tomwood09 @DANIELLUCAS20 How do you know they aren't? It's early days. It's only Feb and he's got a goal and an assist., ...]</td>

Russia's not risking sorties with any cargo helicopters. As many as the AFU have already taken out, Russia's shot down at least one of its own -- a Ka-52 "Alligator".

Hopefully that'll force a few more of these Facebook Group-educated, Joe Rogan horse-paste eating simps to get a goddamn vaccine so we can get out of this. \n\nUntil then.... https://t.co/R2SYCCKZ1S, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Nope. Just can't penetrate the density., @themanpanda @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Like how their vaccinated status accelerates their recovery? ✅✅\n\nOr how it significantly decreases the likelihood of them ending up there in the first place? ✅✅, @CLAdams2 @themanpanda @ShiningSage @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Ignorance and density.\n\nKinda concerning that 9% of our population is so susceptible to this kind of inability to comprehend the information they've been given. \n\nBaffling., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau If you have a dinner party with 10 people and one (10%) person eats 50% of the food and 9 people are left to split the remaining 50% themselves, 9 people took too much. \n\nStatistically speaking, the unvaccinated are draining our resources and vaccines remain incredibly effective., @themanpanda @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau I agree with your statement. We SHOULD do more to promote healthy and active lifestyles especially given the links between obesity and serious covid problems. Not to mention the additional strains on our HC system. \n\nA sugar tax, less screen time, and more phys Ed is start., @themanpanda @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Alcoholics too. More funding for mental health programs and rehabilitation as preventative measures to reduce the strains on our healthcare system., @Lleicht19 @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau You're being ironic, right?\n\nThis is the only appropriate response to your truly baffling statement: https://t.co/swVdjv9sIl, @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau I agree! We should put more funding into preventative measures to minimize the impacts of alcohol, drugs and tobacco on our healthcare system. \n\nWe should continue to invest in mental health, decriminalizing all drugs, tax sugar, and make physical health a national priority., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/W2jFx1aU7r, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Also I see in your self referenced quote that you conveniently removed the bit about "in the hospital".\n\n Lmao. You move those goalposts, panda man! https://t.co/smSShqQ5dT, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Source: Ontario website last night. \nKids 5-11 not included because their vaccines are still rolling out so that's a slightly flawed dataset. https://t.co/qw22M8U1gP, @themanpanda @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau I'm claiming (and subsequently PROVING) that the unvaccinated are taking up hospital beds AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES TO THE VACCINATED. \n\nFFS. Repeating your same ignorant, moronic statement is just repeating that you don't understand what you're talking about., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau And I've never once mentioned positivity rates.🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️\n\nCases ≠ hospitalizations or ICU admissions (we see this in international modelling). \n\nI'm specifically talking about hospitalization and ICU admissions and haven't mentioned cases once., @themanpanda @CLAdams2 @ShiningSage @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau I can't believe that 9% of the population represents 50% of the *COVID* ICU beds. Ffs. Density., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau You're showing cases. Not hospitalizations or ICU admissions. Which, again, disproportionately skew towards the unvaxxed., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau I want you to share your source just so I can give you an education on proportionality. So you show yours and then I'll show you how to properly read data., @themanpanda @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Yes. But the first part about vaccinated people taking up beds is only true if the base populations for both vaccinated and UNvaccinated are the same. And they're not. \n\nAgain, demonstrating your lack of understanding of how statistics work., @ShiningSage @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau No way is this thing going away for a long time. Which is why the gov needs to pivot the messaging asap to what it means to be covid+ and how we're gonna function in that reality. It's obvious that the strength is waning. But we're still panicking over "cases" 🙄, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau One other thing to note: most of Ontario reports incidental covid positivity as a "hospitalization" (Ottawa an exception to this). \n\nPair that with the lack of available testing outside of a hospital and it's likely that  reported "covid hospitalizations" are significantly less., @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau The public option is the vaccine. You decline the public option, you foot the bill. \n\nThe care is in the preventative measures that the vaccine helps provide. Silver bullet? No. But *statistically* significantly better at keeping patients from requiring resource-draining care., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau It's Twitter bud. There's a character limitation. I said ICU admissions - sorry that I didn't clarify that they were ICU COVID admissions as i thought that was assumed given it's what we're talking about., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau The tweet you just replied to was me clarifying what I meant. \n\nI didn't say 50% of beds. I said 50% of ICU admissions and clarified in a follow up tweet that by "ICU admissions" I didn't add "covid" in front of it. Kindly catch up., @themanpanda @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Gulags, obviously. 🙄 https://t.co/KBYFiFcmBW, @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Then we got into how Panda doesn't understand how stats work, I accidentally didn't clarify that we were taking about Covid-beds, Panda got hung up on that, you joined the conversation and told me to fuck off and now we're back to you dense fucks not understanding how stats work., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Correction to this: the *one person* took too much and the 9 people were left with too little., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Let's look at Ontario:\n\nHospitalizations:\nUnvaxxed 12+: 9% of pop; 25% of "hosp"\nVaxxed 12+: 88% of pop; 68% of "hosp"\n\nICU admissions:\nUnvaxxed 12+: 9% of pop; 51% of ICU \nVaxxed 12+: 88% of pop; 36% of ICU \n\nMissing percentages are the half-vaxxed., @themanpanda @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau No disagreement, as mentioned. Lockdowns are ridiculous &amp;amp; were implemented on bad data (incidental hospitalizations). \n\nI think we agree that lockdowns do more harm than good. But again, you don't recognize the over representation of unvaxxed in hosp/ICU compared to pop density., @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau I literally just gave you a primer on stats, bruh. You can't possibly be this dense., @ShiningSage @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau But if you're that committed to the cause of ignorance and stupidity... 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau So there. That's how statistics work. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. https://t.co/jRFze0w8Yq, @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Plus a random mention of the Saudis. Holy smokes. What a gem of a tweet. Bahaha., @ShiningSage @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau *covid beds. As panda rightfully pointed out. \n\nThis is still a very small portion of total ICU beds., @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Nobody is debating the *count* here, bud. The point is that counting is an inaccurate way to determine vaccine efficacy because it conveniently ignores the size of the base populations of vaxxed &amp;amp; unvaxxed. \n\nYou're just showing again &amp;amp; again that you don't understand math., @JimGoughTrans @FabioMorais @JustinTrudeau Sorry Jim - I misread your tweet and came at you like you were an antivaxxer. Deleted previous tweet. Apologies. Stay strong amongst these simps. 🙌👍, @themanpanda @ShiningSage @CLAdams2 @justwokeup2life @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Covered for their care. Not denied it. \n\nThink of it as a tax on the ignorant., @ShiningSage @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Here's a screenshot from just now showing the availability of beds. \n\nImportant to remember that there's a major staff shortage right now. https://t.co/X44tL0vZND, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Welp. This nut is too dense to crack. Good luck panda. This one's for you: https://t.co/9WD8A6R0hL, @Lleicht19 @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Your selfishness is why we're still in this mess. https://t.co/NDXrpG4dls, @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau So while, numerically, there appear to be more unvaccinated people in the hospital, statistically, there are more unvaccinated people in the hospital., @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Your body! Your choice! .. your bill! \n\nIf you decline the public option: the free vaccine; you should foot the bill for your care. https://t.co/3yT3SbCgFn, @ShiningSage @themanpanda @justwokeup2life @CLAdams2 @ManFellow2 @JustinTrudeau Well if we could give smokers a magic pill or jab that would prevent or reduce the likelihood of their ICU admission, that'd be a good thing... \n\nCanada could do what NZ did with tobacco sales...

Works a peach., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Avoiding? No. I just find it difficult to respond. The foundations of the "dam" rail bridge and tracks were damaged on the 13th. I know of no other rail bridge that's usable. The ferries have been in operation for a month. If they could add capacity, they would've done so., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva BTW: Russia's puppet "deputy governor for Kherson", Kirill Stremousov, has fled to Russia. He's currently at the Voronezh Marriott hotel about 730 km away from Kherson. A real profile in courage., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva We have not "established" anything of the sort. What supply line is still "open", in you opinion?, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva A T-72 tank weighs ~40-tons. Depending on the ferry's displacement buoyancy they might be able to move tanks -- but once take start staging tanks the rally points instantly become a target. HIMARS can launch 6 times faster than it's Russian counterpart., @AntDisgruntled @Incogni24904873 @TZeroinnocent @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva "Attacking the messenger" is not an argument. If you have contradicting "mindless narrative lies", by all means, please present them., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The bridge you told me to Google apparently has the same name as this: \n\nhttps://t.co/AttmLo65yp, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Nobody disputes it but the Russians, and they lie about everything. After blowing up MH17, The Buk missile launcher responsible was photographed by multiple sources fleeing along the H21 motorway back to Russia. It belonged to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. https://t.co/kEWqMpuqij, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva I'd struggle to find 4 countries that would want you., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The sanctions aren't hurting the west. Both European electricity and natural gas prices are collapsing; Electricity futures are down -50% in a week; and Germany's says shortages won't be an issue this winter.  Putin's losing his last ounce of leverage. \nhttps://t.co/xZlI5j48vz, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva You saying that if I didn't use my real name or picture, I could have medals from multiple conflict zones too? How exciting! Can I be King of Luxembourg too?, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The ferries? Lets' see... max 30 vehicles per ferry; traveling 1 km @ an average of 5 knots; plus loading and unloading time at both ends. What is that? A bit less than 1 vehicle per minute? On a bridge designed to handle about 12,000 vehicles (AVV) per day?, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva My apologies Commodore. 🫡  We were unaware of this "one route" you speak of. Also these "boats" you mention, since the Russian navy -- along with their empty combat support ships -- fled the Black sea a while ago. Also, Russia wouldn't risk sending an IL-76 into a combat area., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The Russian knew it when I did. Wait. You mean the phony dog-and-pony show of pretending to "repair" the bridge? They couldn't allow Ukraine a "propaganda" victory -- not while the world is watching. They're embarrassed. They need to trivialize any success by Ukraine., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva No. I mean the dead and mutilated kids in any one of hundreds of apartment buildings and civilian structures targeted in "retaliatory" or so-call "vengeance" strikes in purely residential areas. Usually over 10-block radii because they're using non-precision munitions., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva No... it's because you're a coward. \nhttps://t.co/ONrLONbNet, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva So. Speaking as a "combat engineer", why has no one tried to build a 1 km pontoon bridge before? Is it because it's impossible to defend? Or, because the math simply doesn't work? Personally... I think it's because Putin hadn't yet provided the necessary encouragement... https://t.co/MbP3ZqskNP, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Russia claimed it was a flicked cigarette and blamed Ukraine for it. That tells you as much about their credibility as you need to know., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva You have the ferry. Nothing more. Russia's not risking sorties with any cargo helicopters. As many as the AFU have already taken out, Russia's shot down at least one of its own -- a Ka-52 "Alligator". Russia's ECM simply doesn't work against MPADS., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva "Literally ignoring" versus what? "Figuratively" ignoring? How does that even work? Is that "combat" grammer?Anyway... Ferries are inadequate, the pontoon is only 60% complete, and what rail bridge you're referring to? I'm only aware of the Nova Kakhovka knocked out on the 13th., @StevenJulia9 @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Yes. Stremousov's fled to Russia. He's currently at the Voronezh Marriott hotel about 730 km from Kherson. Another Russian "Profile in Courage"., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva A treaty with Russia isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Sanctions are a last resort, but they are the only kind of pressure Russia actually respects., @Incogni24904873 @AntDisgruntled @TZeroinnocent @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Battle of Khasham. 500 Wagner mercs and Syrians. The US was on the deconfliction line with the Russian liaison while taking fire. "Are these your guys?", we asked. "Never heard of them.", replied the Russians. "Well, alrighty then!", we said... and then handed them their asses., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Point is, Russian sanctions have virtually nothing to do with it. Upside is European electricity and natural gas prices are falling. Electricity futures are down about 50% in a week. Expect some relief soon., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva I mean you should actually read what it says. \nhttps://t.co/4fTef7Gzka, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Also a regular bike, but the best time for biking is early morning. Rice fields are everywhere. https://t.co/jiFjek1c0i, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva BTW: The United States is going back to the Moon today. Not to be outdone, Russia is launching its own rocket today... into another apartment building full of kids., @sinserrex @doncalli @AntDisgruntled @Navsteva An M31 is actually about US$165K (built with loving care by the friendly folks at General Dynamics).\nSo, HIMARS missile -- $165K\nThe look on Putin's face when his evil schemes are thwarted -- Priceless, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The rail bridge on you map was knocked out by a HIMARS strike on July 30th. It may have received further strikes since. \nhttps://t.co/O781N7RovP, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva It's not "another" option. It's the ONLY option. 1 km long, lashed in place, with a current moving at 1 to 2 m/sec. Like to see the math on THAT. The first time its hit will likely be its last. Then, welcome to Eastern Europe's first underwater tunnel. 🐠🐟, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Lactase is produced in the gut unless you keep at it -- kids don't generally drink milk beyond weening. Cereal is $7.00 a box in Cambodia, so that's not an option if you're earning $5 per day. I've got patents in a number of technologies -- I'm fine financially., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva New York, Beverly Hills, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. I just go where the work takes me. Single and no pets, but the scenery changes and I like the food., @StevenJulia9 @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Thanks. I think they've switched his meds. He's very loquacious today. He's an anonymous coward, and uses that to his advantage. We actually use our real names., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva By either side? That must have been rather humiliating for you., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The bridge is a tensile structure. The holes punched by the missiles destroyed the bridge tendons INSIDE, and the span is now no longer in tension. It cannot support any significant loads. The damaged sections need to be demolished, recast, and re-tensioned. 3-4 months work., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva I'm in southeast Asia setting up 2 new companies right now. I find I like Cambodia very much. It's beautiful, the people are great, and the opportunity factor is similar to Thailand of, say, 20 years ago. I bought a motorcycle just so I'd have one here to use., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Yes and yes. I interviewed the directors and staff of several children's hospitals, and half the kids they see are there for nutritional issues. (the other half are parasites, infections, and injuries) It's the ones that DON'T get to hospitals that I really worry about., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva You don't have to be an expert in tensor calculus to know the bridge is fucked. Calling what happened "a few holes" is like dismissing a few mosquito bites while ignoring the raging case of malaria its caused. No band-aid will fix that. It's structurally unsound., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva A perpetrator denying a charge carries no weight in a court of law. Pleas of "not guilty" are generally entered by default. The evidence and thus Russia's culpability in the MH17 shootdown is not in dispute., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Before you ask, vitamin and calcium supplements are not an option -- There's no way to distribute them -- an people don't understand what they are, or why it's not enough just to feed their kids until they're full., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva "Hard to get actual info on that one...." Uh huh... I used the secret code: "nova kakhovka dam bridge" in the Google machine to find this for you. Russian Telegram group reports it's been hit again since this photo was taken. https://t.co/WpyEYAQRDe, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Russia wasn't even competent at supplying food, medical supplies, or potable water to their own troops in peacetime. Their logistics are a joke. Just imagine how bad it is in a shooting war. #CannonMeat, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva The motorcycle plant is early-stages. I'm working with the chairman of one of the largest motorcycle manufacturing operations in China. I've known him for 12 years. Everything got sidelined with Covid, but were ready to start again. Honda already has a factory in Cambodia., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva As I said, about half of the UK's gas comes from the North Sea, and a third is sourced from Norway. 83% of what the UK is using. If you're freezing this winter, the problem didn't start with Russian sanctions., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Ukraine's "only success" being choking off the supply chain north of the Dniper and isolating Russia's troops there. BTW: denying an enemy use of a bridge IS exploiting it. They make movies about things like that. Where, exactly, did you learn "combat engineering"?, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva It's not "documented" by anyone. Russia is using non-precision ordinance so they can't effectively "target" anything. They just saturation bomb it all. When they inevitably hit schools, apartments, and homes, they say "Oh, AFU were hiding there." It's total bullshit., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva 8 years of WHAT shelling? The Russian attack in the Donbass began in 2014, and the majority of casualties - 2084 - occured in that single year. More than 14% of them were from a single incident - Russia's killing of 298 passengers on Malaysian Airlines MH17., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Yes. They have 2 ferries -- it's not enough. I thought we established that. Yes. I'm sure they could steal a few bass boats with beer coolers... although... the fact they have to steal what they need suggests their operational plan wasn't particularly well-thought out., @AntDisgruntled @Incogni24904873 @TZeroinnocent @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva I'm not involved in that conversation. I merely made an observation. Thrash it out with @Incogni24904873., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Cambodia and Laos are calcium deserts. This results in stunting, wasting, and developmental issues in children. The US solved this with fortified foods like cereal and milk. That's not an option in parts SE Asia. I think I've cracked it, however. Not a money-maker, but needed., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva At 50°02'09.0"N, 29°48'34.0"E? That bridge is over 430 kilometers from Kherson -- it has no relevance at all. It crosses the Unava River just SW of Kiev. Did you even bother to look it up?, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva What are you talking about?! About half of the UK's gas comes from the North Sea, and a third is sourced from Norway. That's 83%. Very little of the UK's gas actually came directly from Russia. If you've got problems, it has little to do with Russia or sanctions., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Well it's not open. Stop listening to Russian trolls. "Actual events", as you call them, are determined by real things like bridges being out or not. On Earth One we call this "causality". Ignoring reality and causality is something we call "mental illness". Are you ill?, @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva One's a non-profit -- low-cost nutrient fortified foods for rural communities which comprise 80% of the population there. The other is a motorcycle assembly plant for low-cost bikes and scooters. Honda dominates the market there, but their prices are way too high., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Yes that happened. In 1996, the governments of the U.S. and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice. The US agreed to pay the families of the Iranian victims US$61.8 million in compensation. In contrast, Russia denies all responsibility for its incident., @AntDisgruntled @StevenJulia9 @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva Nice. That said, I'm so acclimated to this part of the world, I'll probably never see snow again. 😉, @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva It's a prestressed box girder concrete bridge. They've been built the same way for generations. Ukrainian engineers knew how to take one out -- as much Russian engineers knew what they were looking at when they did., @AntDisgruntled @sinserrex @doncalli @Navsteva What building are you referring to? I've not heard of it. I've seen strikes on civilian buildings being used as command posts -- Wagner Group being a recent example. It looks like this... a surgical strike, based on actual intel, with little collateral damage. https://t.co/uKSYtVEFDx]</td>

Listen, I know what gots into hotdogs, and I am fine with that. but adding mayo, too far., @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC Well, I tried. Why did you delete your tweet where you said you would keep on slapping? I wish you the best and I am sorry you would rather fight people than engage in meaningful dialogue. https://t.co/xc28ctdb36, @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC Clearly you dont know me or you would know how stupid of a statement that is... If I was worried about that I wouldn't have been one of 2 house republicans to sponsor a state wide NDO or the only elected R to speak to my city in favor of passing an NDO pissing off primary voters, @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC Let's consider this a rough start to a budding friendship and agree to engage in positive, respectful, productive dialogue moving forward?, @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC And some honest feedback, if you want to engage in serious dialogue, dont try to verbally slap the person you want to talk to open the conversation.

Don't make ridiculous statements about the person., @gblanstonku @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC To a local Lawrence family, from what I understand is very much not anti-lgbt. I understand that some profits go to HQ and then some there to the family that is anti-LGBT, but that train leads to the need to boycott A LOT more businesses I think., @ToryMArnberger @BPeppered @kwhit14 @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA Matt Right now... https://t.co/RVBqA0BDxG, @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC *shrug* suit your self Mr. Turner. I have stated my preference that I don't prefer use of my title., @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC I think that is 100% fair response from you and how to allocate your money. No one has shown me how Chick-Fil-A is discriminatory yet. Only that the owner of the brand (not KU Franchise) is anti-LGBT (which I agree, he is). I am open-minded and willing to listen., @gblanstonku @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC I legit chuckled out loud when I read that. Well played., @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC Trying to show the respect back since you indicated you preferred it. You never needed permission, was just stating my personal preference. Sadly, I can't promise you that. I appreciate the feedback. Maybe I will include it on my next survey., @BPeppered @ToryMArnberger @kwhit14 @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA OMG. Tory, I was usually joking about impeaching you but now I gotta go look up to see if this is an impeachable offense. My gut says yes. Will there be hotdogs with mayo at your wedding?, @patricklclark @MattCalcara @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews Fair question. Im not sure, I think if people dont want to eat there, they shouldnt, I dont think the University should remove them purely on the basis that they disagree with the personal beliefs of the brand owner. Is there any discrimination built into the brand itself?, @sykesjs @kwhit14 @BPeppered @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA You are right, I should probably put the worst condiment on them to add insult to injury. Thank you for helping me see this error!, @MattCalcara @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews Matt, no, they wouldn't. Why? Because the Chick-Fil-A in Lawrence is a local franchise owned by a Lawrence family. They are Chinese immigrants who have built a life in Kansas. And from what I know about them, they would never allow that., @MattCalcara @kwhit14 @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC You haven't shown me how the company itself is discriminating. You showed me they got a zero score and didnt break down the scoring or why it got a zero. What policies discriminate?, @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @MattCalcara @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews Does Chick-Fil-A directly discriminate? That is a real question. If they do as a company, if in their company policy is anti-LGBT stuff I think that changes the dialogues, but is there or is is disagreement with the owner of the brand’s personal religous views?, @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC I never said that. So....as of now, your comment, still stupid. Now you just owe me one as no trade was made., @MattCalcara @marcusaturner @gavinesq @ksucats96 @kwhit14 @Shereste @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA @sanjanakaranth @HuffPost Do you know if they go by a different name on here? I cant find them listed and have been searching as well as reading the report and looking up other companies., @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @MattCalcara @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews The highest profits stay with the local owner. Usually Chick-Fil-A franchises cant be bought by just money, its very hard to get one and based on other factors, money being low on priority list. I dont think this family was overly weathly by any means at the start., @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC I dont have an issue with CFA being on KU campus if the company itself is not discriminating against anyone and should not be kicked off campus solely because the brand owners personal religious views (even though I think he is very wrong in them). If CFA discriminates, boot them, @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC are you even reading the conversation? I've never said there is no evidence. I have asked for it. Man, go listen to Taylor Swift's new song, it is great and super relevant to your tweets. This is a conversation, want to join it? Act like an adult please., @patricklclark @MattCalcara @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews So you punish a local family who likely do not share those views by running their business off campus because the founder of the brand they franchise holds those personal views? How is that helping the cause? You just give fuel to your opponents and didnt move the needle a cm., @LeviABx @BPeppered @kwhit14 @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA Mostly box lunches really, but yeah. You can mass order for sure., @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC I dont think I am splitting hairs on my point. People are accusing CFA of being anti-LGBT. I dont disagree the owner is anti-LGBT, but that is still a big difference. I dont have any issue with people not eating there because of your point. Just like....., @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC And again, I 100% support people boycotting eating there. I just think kicking them off campus is honestly going to do more harm than good to the LGBT movement. I think it will rally the anti-LGBT and give them a flag to wave compared to help the cause, but just my 2 cents., @BPeppered @kwhit14 @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA Monsters live among us., @BPeppered @kwhit14 @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA I will agree ketchup on a chick-fil-a sandwich is like mayo on a hotdog, I mean, if you need that, then just order something else., @gavinesq @marcusaturner @ksucats96 @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA @sanjanakaranth @HuffPost You make a lot of strong arguments and I appreciate the discussion on all of this. I was hoping to see productive conversation on different thoughts on this issue and think there has been! Lots to consider without a doubt., @marcusaturner @ksucats96 @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA @sanjanakaranth @HuffPost Man, I thought you had stopped caring! I feel so loved again 🥰, @gavinesq @gblanstonku @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC Like KSU and its nike partnership, which uses slave labor to produces it products. All the companies profiting off the deforestation of the Amazon. It is a slippery slope. I also think it opens KU open to a lawsuit if they cite the religious beliefs of the owner as cause., @MattCalcara @gavinesq @marcusaturner @ksucats96 @kwhit14 @Shereste @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA @sanjanakaranth @HuffPost On that note, I 100% believe in banning "conversion therapy" and agree with you it is torture from what I have read about it. On this we quite agree., @BPeppered @kwhit14 @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA Controversial take, but I only ever want their BBQ sauce on my sandwich. Frustratingly, they never include it in their catering it seems., @kwhit14 @BPeppered @KS_TaxEconomist @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KUnews @HRC @ChickfilA I eat my shark clean. They don't put condiments on us and I show them the same respect., @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC KU has been with them for more than a decade. I like to ask people who dont care about politics about politics a lot. We often live in a bubble &amp;amp; forget how non-political people view things. Overwhelmingly on this one, people think its going "too extreme". That is all., @marcusaturner @gavinesq @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC thank you, but please call me Tom., @gavinesq @gblanstonku @kwhit14 @Shereste @MattCalcara @letitiaharmon @patricklclark @KS_TaxEconomist @KUnews @HRC You are an attorney so would know more on case law than me, but wouldn't that make it worse. Means they got kicked off when their company isnt informed by their religious practices. Though I think we know it is to some level (closed sundays)]</td>

You need to ask the Leader of NYCC about the liability he has exposed his authority too, @MrChrisClay_ @DefundWty @HarrogateScribe @neilfaddy @JayMitchinson @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk @JamesMason_78 No problem Chris.

The very thing @JayMitchinson and @yorkshirepost have campaigned against.  Public money deserves Public debate, @neilfaddy @MrChrisClay_ @JayMitchinson @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk That is for others to decide. But either way throwing money at WTY without open competition after WTY recent past isn't the way forward.  I appreciate you are defining your organisation.  My job is different and that is to ensure tax payers get value for money., @JayMitchinson @JamesMason_78 @OpinionYP @yorkshirepost @IanDayPix @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk James it not the past.  The company is bankrupt and in debt now.  That's why they can't put the accounts in. I agree a world class marketing for Yorkshire. But that isn't a campaign to save WTY, @neilfaddy @JayMitchinson @MrChrisClay_ @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk I would want want them employed in a sustainable tourism organisation . I  can't add anything else.  It's not the role of the tax payer to keep loaning and bankrolling millions of pounds to WTY., @neilfaddy @JayMitchinson @MrChrisClay_ @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk Oh the sweet irony.  Quite a lot of the £1.4M will be used for legacy issues not future employment.  I want sustainable jobs in a tourism marketing organisation not ones that can only survive with multi million pound tax bailouts., @JamesMason_78 @OpinionYP @yorkshirepost @JayMitchinson @IanDayPix @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk Oh James you know and I know you have been trading as a non ongoing entity. The money you seek not off Councils but from taxes they hold is to show that in the short-term you have cash. It's all coming to a messy but predicted end, @MrChrisClay_ @DefundWty @JamesMason_78 @OpinionYP @yorkshirepost @JayMitchinson @IanDayPix @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk Really you clearly haven't followed the WTY saga over the last 2 year's if you have to ask me that! My issue is with neither! My issue is to protect public tax payers money, @DefundWty @HarrogateScribe @neilfaddy @MrChrisClay_ @JayMitchinson @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk @JamesMason_78 I had a good twitter chat with him this afternoon and he was very good at open discussion with me. So a little surprised, @neilfaddy @MrChrisClay_ @JayMitchinson @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk This sense of entitlement to tax\npayers money by WTY has is largely part of the problem.  The tax payer has no duty to pay a penny to WTY.  The best way to ensure tax payers money goes on the best organisation to promote Yorkshire is to go for competitive competition 1/2, @neilfaddy @MrChrisClay_ @JayMitchinson @OpinionYP @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk The excesses were by the previous leadership.  I come back to my role to get value for money for tax payers.  WTY financial position is dire, also indebted.  I'm back to where we stated. I appreciate you are doing your best.  But I'm not happy with £1.4m going to WTY at present., @JayMitchinson @MrChrisClay_ @yorkshirepost @JamesMason_78 @OpinionYP @IanDayPix @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk With respect back.  It did! The last 2 years has been a battle to save its trading position. It still is deep debt, trading as a non legal entity. Tax payers money will go to pay redundancy and back debt not on future tourism. It's had  it's time and tax payer £.  change needed, @JamesMason_78 @OpinionYP @yorkshirepost @JayMitchinson @IanDayPix @ChrisBurn_Post @Dales_Tourism @Welcome2Yorks @keanedunk Basically if you filed now it would show you are a bankrupt private company so by law have to wind up.

The situation is fatal for the baby. It’s also dangerous for the mother…it is morally licit to save a mother’s life, even at her baby’s expense.”, @zunguzungu It’s not a news report but a clearly labeled opinion column by a guest. \n\nI don’t care for it one bit but you completely missed the point - opinion pages should provide a wide range of opinions, especially those you dislike so we can have robust debate., @ItsBrandt @zunguzungu I wonder what horrible harms must arise when I stay silent during the pledge at "under god." \nPublishing her piece, it strikes me, is more likely to make more people realize how silly and self-serving her "baby" views are than to persuade others to join her., @sugarchick10 @kathy4kamalaVP @CATnOATS @zunguzungu Never read her other work so can't comment. Clearly she is anti-abortion, no one can miss that.\n\nBut she also steps away from Missouri-style absolutism by saying EP care is necessary.

Baquet ran the new side which has nothing to do with the opinion pages.

Yup.\n\nHer argument seems to be that the fetus should be treated as a child and docs should speak respectfully., @mjdix8 @zunguzungu Doctors in states that have criminalized abortion will hesitate and no doubt some will  refuseto provide care to a woman with a failed pregnancy out of fear they will become a victim of a zealot., @sugarchick10 @kathy4kamalaVP @CATnOATS @zunguzungu A.

Sympathy for The Other, even killers, is critical to building trust., @KinnaBeck @zunguzungu The essay says exactly what you wrote: all ectopic pregnancies fail and without care the woman dies.\n\nDid  you read the piece? Your tweet suggest not., @jenniferhclarke @zunguzungu Please quote the line where the writer says an a topic pregnancy can be carried to live birth. Maybe I missed it. \n\nIf a woman with an ectopic pregnancy wants to risk her life, since death is virtually certain, would you deny her choice, however idiotic?, @ItsBrandt @zunguzungu What she wrote at top:\n\n“In an ectopic pregnancy, the baby implants somewhere other than the uterus — usually in a fallopian tube.

It’s also dangerous for the mother…it is morally licit to save a mother’s life, even at her baby’s expense.”, @KJBean164 @CATnOATS @zunguzungu right!, @CATnOATS @zunguzungu The article says all ectopic pregnancies fail &amp;amp; w/o removal the woman dies.\n\nThe writer wants doctors to refer to her fetus as a “baby“ that was “delivered.“\n\nThat’s nutty, but her opinion is shared by a lot of people. \n\nDoes a woman’s autonomy exclude her opinions?, @kathy4kamalaVP @CATnOATS @zunguzungu Nowhere did I write that a clump of cells is a baby. I called the writer's views on that silly, juvenile, fact-free and nonsense. I take it you missed that., @laurelneiko @zunguzungu The rider says that right up at the top of the piece - there will be no live birth and unless treated the mother will die. That’s correct., @scruffage @dinerlee @zunguzungu The op-ed:\n\n“In an ectopic pregnancy, the baby implants somewhere other than the uterus — usually in a fallopian tube. The situation is fatal for the baby. It’s also dangerous for the mother…it is morally licit to save a mother’s life, even at her baby’s expense.”, @kathy4kamalaVP @CATnOATS @zunguzungu So should women not be allowed to have a voice on issues affecting men? Really? And what in my view did you find offensive since you don't specify.\nPlease, be specific., @MariaLacombe @zunguzungu How so? Top of essay:\n\n“In an ectopic pregnancy, the baby implants somewhere other than the uterus — usually in a fallopian tube. The situation is fatal for the baby. It’s also dangerous for the mother…it is morally licit to save a mother’s life, even at her baby’s expense.”, @radleftie @kw1979 @zunguzungu So, @radleftie, you’re dropping into what aboutism. \n\nAs noted above the writer gets the science on ectopic pregnancies right. \n\nThat she wants docs to call her baby a fetus is silly, but doesn’t harm anyone anymore than when I don’t say “under God” during the pledge., @Tristanshouts @thequeengeek @zunguzungu If her view was unique I’d be with you, but I’ve known or interviewed many people who hold such views. \n\nI think it’s good to air them so we can see how preposterous and self-serving they are., @nicojanssen @zunguzungu Evidently you didn’t read the article which says clearly that all ectopic pregnancies fail and without care of the woman dies. \n\nThe writer is a woman, not a man,  who holds some peculiar views that are shared by millions of Americans, namely that a fetus or a zygote is a baby., @WizBob @zunguzungu The piece says clearly that all ectopic pregnancies fail and without care the woman dies. How did you miss that if you read the essay?, @BeccaRocks7399 @CATnOATS @zunguzungu Agreed. But doctors also need not be callous. I've seen plenty of docs be callous to me, family, &amp;amp; observing ER activity as a reporter. \nA smart doc can avoid "baby" without thoughtlessly responding to miscarrying woman. We know many docs unconsciously treat women, POC poorly., @ItsBrandt @zunguzungu The writer doesn’t dispute that. She makes it clear right up front that the fetus is not going to become a child and the mother will die if nothing is done to end the pregnancy.]</td>

But that's tied DEEPLY into Israel/Palestine @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo take away SS from those who don't NEED it; expand it for those who do need it. Seems so obvious. @HillaryGuess @Lucretius4, @JustABonobo Maybe, or maybe the change is too slow for people to notice, not fast enough to address grievances... @HillaryGuess @JD344, @HillaryGuess Notion is fomented &amp;amp; manipulated by leaders &amp;amp; media via cultural assumptions abt biological inevitability. @JustABonobo @JD344, @JD344 In age of nuclear weapons &amp;amp; nation, religion, etc groups it's impressive that tribalism hasn't done worse. @HillaryGuess @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess When Hillary said all options remain on the table if Iran "cheats" on deal, creates an easy "excuse" to go to war!, @HillaryGuess You'll see modern use of the term when you hear of the other name for ISIS (ISIL) Islamic State of Iraq &amp;amp; Levant. @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo Honestly why they probably dropped Glenn Beck. His conspiracy stuff was whipping up some to take criminal action! @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo SS needs reform esp SSDisability which is near its limit. Rich don't need SS. That's the first reform @HillaryGuess @Lucretius4, @HillaryGuess They belong to even arbitrary groups. As @JD344 said, competition is strong drive between group identities.

And more. @HillaryGuess @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo Our society is ill.

Privilege/systemic-racism education are being floated. @JustABonobo @JD344, @JD344 Glad you seem to be having fun wandering back though a complex and varying conversation, friend :), @HillaryGuess The "othering" of different nationalities is hard to undo. Need to undo this tendency of tribalism (nationalism). @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo Some do say that. Certainly there are complex interconnections as the proxy war is waged in the Levant. @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo For a long time now, we've been living off the resources of future generations. It's classic unsustainable @JD344 @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess But how quickly justice morphs into vengeance if there's not forgiveness first.

Is it progress to develop nuclear tech., or a step backward? @JustABonobo @JD344, @HillaryGuess He isn't the best communicator, but he held his own pretty well, and Baier was not too bad by Fox standards! @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo Friend, what subject matter do you see as most important 4 realigning the political calculus toward Waging Peace? @HillaryGuess, @JD344 Trying to fix everything AT ONCE may be part of the problem. But no single issue should be above reproach! @JustABonobo @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo Exactly! Was thinking the same thing, actually. :) @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo And ppl get rich &amp;amp; powerful off of this illness, without realizing they're contributing to the increasing malaise @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Point is be careful in looking at violence and wars whenever they've been glorified especially by a state. @JustABonobo @JD344, @JustABonobo Or both be partially right. MidEast is a bit like economics; even so-called experts don't understand it all :) @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Wish there was more appetite in the media &amp;amp; Dem party for discussing a radical shift in US foreign policy toward Waging Peace!, @JustABonobo Wonder if the technology balance involves finding a way to prioritize some tech advances and not others @JD344 @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo How to make change lasting &amp;amp; equitable, even to those who used to benefit most. Justice is not revenge. @HillaryGuess @JD344, @JustABonobo American Revolution was only NOT treason because the victors write the history books. Glorified violence @HillaryGuess @JD344, @JustABonobo Why is civil disobedience a touchy subject? :) @HillaryGuess @JD344, @HillaryGuess Region of "Greater Syria" which often refers to modern countries of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan &amp;amp; Israel/Palestine. @JustABonobo, @JD344 Must accept conflict, but reject violent- esp mass scale war- expressions of that conflict. @JustABonobo @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess You can see it in Hillary's Syria solution: send more weapons into that chaos, &amp;amp; faster. Saying that would have stopped it., @JustABonobo Sad, for example, that diversity of views is often not civil, or is blocked immediately. There is use to MSM @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Please don't say they STILL use the tagline "Fair and Balanced". Fox News should at least be honest RW propaganda @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess This is key question. Studies done on human behavior show tendency toward extremism in cases where (1/2) @JustABonobo @JD344, @JustABonobo It certainly does appear that a cycle of endless war opportunity and war action is feeding on itself. MI Complex. @HillaryGuess, @Lucretius4 Reject the nation-state's attempt take away &amp;amp; abuse personal patriotism @HillaryGuess @schprockets @JustABonobo @JD344 @sasha031, @JustABonobo Just seems like a matter of time before human error alone sets off a nuke; that's aside from jingoism &amp;amp; terrorism @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess So that's the general region of the proxy war, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria, Abdullah in Jordan etc (1/2) @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo Oh certainly mistakes in proliferation and such, but when several countries have hundreds of nukes aimed &amp;amp; ready. @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo But true also Fox News, MSNBC, some others- are not even MSM anymore. They're party hacks. Reinforce echo chamber @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo Forgiving and forgetting are two very different things.. Otherwise we can't learn from history's mistakes. @HillaryGuess @JD344, @JustABonobo Agreed &amp;amp; while leaders can set an example for the masses, it's grassroots that must effect #Peace culture change! @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Yet Russia still has its nukes and on hair-trigger w/ US. Is the world really that much safer? @JustABonobo @JD344, @JustABonobo Long scale historical model says that the system accommodates change, but only within certain parameters @HillaryGuess @JD344, @JD344 Will be doing some reading on SCT :) @HillaryGuess @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess But main drivers of proxy are, (broadly), Iran &amp;amp; Russia on one end ~&amp;amp; Saudi Arabia, Turkey &amp;amp; US on other (2/2) @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess Yet some claim it is progress. That word is dangerously used. @JustABonobo @JD344, @Lucretius4 Oh do, please :) @HillaryGuess @JustABonobo @JD344 @sasha031, @JD344 &amp;amp; conflict by itself is not inherently bad- but when ppl think the only avenues for redress are violent... @JustABonobo @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo Many movements have proven that Waging Peace can be done non-violently but NOT passively. Clear difference @HillaryGuess @JD344, @HillaryGuess Don't see violent confrontations as acceptable alternative for positive outcomes. Poisons any change. @JD344 @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess As long as the movements continued; prob was relied on charismatic leaders Gandhi, MLK etc who were killed @JustABonobo @JD344, @HillaryGuess Part is de-conflation of racism &amp;amp; individual racists with systemic racism which is much different. @JustABonobo @JD344, @Lucretius4 Autobiography of MX should be required reading in every high school in America. @HillaryGuess @JustABonobo @JD344 @sasha031, @Lucretius4 The nation-state encourages nationalism. And game of follow the leader. @HillaryGuess @schprockets @JustABonobo @JD344 @sasha031, @HillaryGuess Sorry that was little inside. HillaryGuess lives in some kind of incredible paradise. :) @JustABonobo @JD344, @JD344 So glad you got introduced to this conversation, JD! Can see you'll be on a roll again :) @JustABonobo @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Maybe Hillary thinks she must present "macho" persona to become first female POTUS- which would be sad irony (1/2)@JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess "boys will be boys" is a brush-off. humans want peace but taught incorrectly that only recourse is violent @JustABonobo @JD344, @JustABonobo Like Kucinich. Advocated creating Dept. of Peace. We have SO many "defense" depts, ~why not one to reign them in? @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Starting with machine guns and trenches and mustard gas and chlorine gas up to WW1 and ballooning from there... @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess Or don't waste your vote #feelthechafe :) \n\nHey Chafee's one of those rare honest pols too! Great issues they're both raising!, @HillaryGuess Won't get into long argument about this, but would say colonies' invasion of Canada was prob not benefit @JustABonobo @JD344, @HillaryGuess Think humans essentially want peace; "violent nature" is manipulated on mass scale by larger entities @JustABonobo @JD344, @JustABonobo Yes critical thinking and analysis is crucial. Math/Science being pushed but need Critical Thinking curriculum! @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess Exactly. Sad that the word "socialism" &amp;amp; the word "communism" have been distorted in many American minds @JD344 @JustABonobo, @HillaryGuess Think that's Beck's... appeal? @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo Meanwhile real MSM is prone to over-sensationalizing, creating fear sometimes. Balance is good w/ media intake :) @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess However intentional exposure to varying opinions/diversity has huge impact; @JustABonobo- here's where TV has potential @JD344, @JustABonobo Big change is scary. It could rapidly disintegrate into something no one expected- see French Revolution @HillaryGuess @JD344, @JD344 So it seems need a rapid speed-up of socio-ethical development or a slow-down in technological innovation? @JustABonobo @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo Hard to determine, but individual Saudi funding from oil bought in part by US appears to go to Islamist factions. @HillaryGuess, @JustABonobo Polls show American Muslims have commonplace "Americanized" viewpoints, if a little socially conservative. @HillaryGuess, @HillaryGuess So how do we end the cycles? http://t.co/063Dkcji4K @JustABonobo @JD344 @Lucretius4 @sasha031 @WaterflowerM @TessatTys, @HillaryGuess Those settlements are creating a hornets nest of recruitment 4 fundamentalism on BOTH sides. They really must end @JustABonobo, @JustABonobo You didn't say. Thought @HillaryGuess might be implying it in response to // essentially want peace but are manipulated. @JD344, ...]</td>

Because it’s super easy to do so. Let’s just say we disagree on most everything and leave it at that. We can both go our own ways and stop wasting our time trying to change eo minds, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Probably because of the extra hours we will have to work to make the extra money to pay for double the cost of gas from 7 months ago and the crazy inflation of everything else., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews It could be different on my search than yours, but UD google search shows University of Dayton at the top spot and the University of Delaware as the second. It shouldn’t matter which one pops up for you as I wasn’t tryin to give you my life’s history or soc. Either should suffice, @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Things, but their numbers do not match up with state numbers etc. as far as medical knowledge, being a paramedic for the past 15 years, having half my family work in the nursing world and all my other contacts through my job don’t make me an expert, but definitely give me enough, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews I know nothing about public policy? I know that Trumps public policy actually helped the country and its people. What principals have Biden made that have helped the country out? Stop building a wall and open our borders up for millions of illegals to be escorted into the US?, @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Well I must know the 4% then., @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Do nothing but stop some spit. Instead of spending time going back and forth with me, please do some research on the subjects, not using google and you’ll see for yourself captain McNutty., @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews I’m not superior, nor do I think or act as if I am. 4 questions were for you to think about. I’m not a victim, nor tsp I play or act like it. And for not knowing me, I’m glad you can come to the conclusion that you do not like me. You are why the world is the way it is today., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews And see if they die or get better. An illness that causes inflammation of that sits in the lungs. Sounds like pneumonia, but doing so would adjust the number, but not the number from that point forward which is what I was getting at. Change for 2020-2021 but will go back up once, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews The Democrats and a lot of the republican are to blame also for going along with the circus acts currently being put on by our government., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews No I’m not, and you do realize that it is impossible to guess the future on when someone is going to die. I could live to be 112 and we would never know if I was supposed die at 13.5 or 112. They could say 6.5 years,  it that might seem a little extreme. Only want to scare enough, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Lol. Did you even take the time to read past the first paragraph. 1 it was written in January. 2, it states it wasn’t just the “pandemic” yet all the data shows the job joss after the “pandemic” and the states shutting down. Trump didn’t shut down jobs etc. the states did., @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Why do you assume I am a republican? Don’t judge a book by its cover. Just because I talk about research and don’t believe the media? Diseased? My mind can think for itself. It can research &amp;amp; hold a convo without trying to degrade someone to make myself feel better., @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Not to keep this going, but any doctor who knows what a vaccine does and is supposed to do, and also knows that covid is a respiratory illness understands it cannot be fixed or made to go away with one. Not when it isn’t limited to humans alone., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews They stop killing off the older , social security recipients the government can no longer afford., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Currently to be on unemployment keeps numbers down. Taking out a loan for 200k to stay closed for 10 months is not something every business owner can swallow no matter how bad he wants to keep their employees. Also who would loan the money to a closed business? All Trumps fault?, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews To make it seem legit and put a bit of urgency into the situation., @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Knowledge to understand what a vaccine is, and is supposed to do. I understand the science behind micro organisms, virus’s, nano particles etc from my BA in biology. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to find the information needed to understand a regular mask or face covering, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Smart means what? Most people would say smart means intelligence. Some would consider someone with a high IQ smart, Quick-witted, etc... What does it mean to you? Voting for Biden? Believing my body my choice except when it comes to a “vaccine” or experimental drug?, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews The graphs that show growth drop off at the end of the term, which would be during the “pandemic”. The comment at the end about didn’t pump enough money into states has zero to do with jobs. It’s just filler. Pumping money into a state in which nobody can go out and work, doesn’t, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews BA in biology from UD. MA in Education from UD. Fire Science  and paramedic to add onto them. Teaching high School biology, chemistry, science theory, earth science. I’ve also co-taught paramedics and emt-basic and intermediate classes at a local college. I hope that helps you., @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews The fact you trust their medical advice is a joke. Talk to a nurse, a doc, etc, ask them why they are not getting the experimental vax. See what they say, ask them why the hospitals are full, and with whom. Do some of your own research. Google and msm do not count as research., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Again, not a republican, @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Responding to someone who can’t have a conversation without getting their panties caught up in a bunch and trying to use the tactics of a elementary school bully who wants everything to be their way. Move along., @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews What am I lying about? Seriously? What is it with everyone who has a different opinion than you guys, always get super defensive, call people names, degrade other etc. It’s not ok to have other info than you? Am I not allowed to have a picture of our president as my profile?, @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews And to call me a sociopath, is kinda out there. I understand your feelings, you refuse to see others by believing what the media tells you. Trusting in people who are put into positions of government to represent us, not lead us. Almost all governors have zero medical background., @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Talk to people who work at the hospitals. There is a shortage of nurses in most states and will be more quitting as they make the vax mandatory. A full hospital doesn’t mean all floors are even open. Don’t believe everything you see on the news or in the paper., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews What is this supposed to show or prove?, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews And there is no point in publishing my test results. You won’t believe them, you wouldn’t be able to google search them on the first page of results, and anyone with half a brain cell would still think the “media” “doctors” and “scientist” you trust will say it’s bogus., @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Not sure what planet you’ve grown up on, but besides the bs you’re spouting, dems and reps are all people, all able to be nurses or anything else for that matter. By observation I’m pretty sure you’re a dem, so shouldn’t you be all about anyone being anything they want?, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews UD = University if Dayton. Since your google skills seem to be great at finding info, you could have spent 6 seconds trying it to figure that out., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews I know and understand well how it is figured. You kill off a bunch of older people with a “pandemic” and it makes the number drop because the people didn’t reach their guesstimated age of death. Give a couple hundred thousand old people a respiratory illness, stick them on a vent, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Im a confessed republican? Seriously? I just told you I wasn’t. Because you think I am makes you simple minded. Have you paid any attention to what has gone on with Biden and his crew in the past 7 months? And you call me and Republicans cultist fascists? Please look up fascism, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Maybe you missed the first two posts and only saw the third. I’ll assume that’s it or you really have a problem following along., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Believe it only makes matter worse as in what we are seeing now with the vaxd thinking non vaxd are the devil., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews You stating that Biden has done a great job takes any benefit of the doubt I gave you and flushes it down the toilet. It’s not all Biden’s fault though. You can’t blame a person with sundowners for the country turning to crap the way it has in 7 months. Great job in Afghanistan!, @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews What did I deflect other than your opinion? Isn’t this what this platform is about? Having conversation? Getting info out there? Did I call you a liar? Did I question your choice to have a squirrel as you profile? Did I try insulting your intelligence by using big words or, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Knowing she’s not ready for that as well, again just to beat Trump. You vote based on sides rather than what’s right for the country and the people in it. Neither have any business being in the position they are in., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Smart enough to know that being a republican and voting for a republican can and are two different things., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Are you serious? I’m saying that is what happened. DF not what I want to happen or wanted to happen. Seriously! What is wrong with you? You seem educated. Sociopaths have a lack of conscience. Does putting hundreds of sick elderly back in their nursing homes in NY sound familiar?, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews So, say I took said PCR tests and used them in a classroom setting, tested the same two people 4 times with different test and water from the tap 4 times. 3 of the water test positive, each person 2 negative and two positive. I’m really buying into the accuracy. Again, personal, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Already on the first page, in bold font, is false info. Confirmed cases??? Using a False positive throwing PCR test, you get confirmed cases? Please! The PCR test was never made to confirm this virus. That is why it is supposed to be dropped and no longer used to test. https://t.co/agu9DJvhyT, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Simple minded must be what you call moral based self thinkers rather than mob following simple minded, msm believing, anti constitutional cry babies who get upset when someone doesn’t think the same as them, and revert to name calling to feel good about themselves., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Keep your job. Giving a business money could have kept the business open but giving a couple grand to a business that needs 20k to stay open per month makes no sense. Where would it come from. Also, for this who lost a job and have refused to go back to work because it pays more, @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Assume that you don’t know what they are or mean? Questioning me being a Christian is funny. What did I say or do that lead you to think or believe that was not true? Is it not the calling of every Christian to spread the truth? I hope you have a good evening, I am through, @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Well with only so many words you can use, you have to paraphrase. If you go back and reread what I said, it makes total sense. Just in fewer words than I’d like because of the lack of space. CDC lady came out and finally said covid deaths and being marked with covid are different, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews I literally just told you of the experiment I did in one of my biology classes at the end of last year. Not an anecdote. Seriously, I don’t know what your problem is with Republicans, which you think I am, and I am not. But go ahead and keep labeling people., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Knowledge and experiences mixed in with personal contacts in the field using the tests, working in hospitals, dr offices, schools, ambulances etc. Unless you have all these like I do and have, I don’t really know what to say to you. Believe what you want to I guess. Which is fine, @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews So talking with actual people who work in hospitals, as 3/4 of my family work in them is me doubting the msm, then that is exactly what I’m doing. Im not going by the bs they are trying to sell people. Im going by first hand info from frontlines, not someone selling scare tactics, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Thanks for pointing out that I support Trump. Which does not mean I am a republican. Anyone with a brain should be able to see that Biden is not capable to run this country in his current state and shouldn’t have voted for him just to beat Trump. If you want Harris to take over, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews What makes a scientist? A degree? I have that. A job in science? I have that. I’ll go further. I’ve taught it for 15 years. I’ve also been in the field of saving lives for over 15 years. Do I need to show you proof of all this so you don’t think they are republican anecdotes?, @Det_McNutty @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews I didn’t assume anyone was a dem or anything else. I could care less if someone is a dem or rep or anything else for the matter. That stuff is all crap in my eyes. I honestly could care less. I’m not lying about anything. Don’t assume like you say I did, which I didn’t., @Federalist_10 @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews If you believe that, I’m sorry. Not a chance unless they closed them down to scare people. They might be filling up, but not with non-vaxd republicans like you are thinking., @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Conspiring the state/cdc and WHO numbers for states. They don’t match, or don’t for a week until they fix them, and then they mess up again. They can’t keep their facts straight. I’m sorry I can search, investigate and find this stuff easily on my own. If only everyone did this 2, @Federalist_10 @Det_McNutty @ramey_deb @BretBaier @LucasFoxNews Nothing was ever out of control about the pandemic except the media making people freak out and the way it was handled at hospitals. Not allowing drugs to be used that work, states closing down for a strong respiratory illness that can’t be cured by any vac but making people]</td>

Clinton continued, JFK started, Reagan continued, LBJ was a corrupt ole fuck and yes, a democrat administration started it., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Yea, ~10% in state income tax on top of FIT and property tax with failed politicians and corrupt commies will do that to ya., @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Uhh, no, that’s false.  OU, at its best, would send you left coast queers straight to hell., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ The article title is “per capita”, you dumb fuck, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Maybe cross check that with most affordable states to live in and it may not be what you think., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ The doctors and professionals helping it were ALL volunteer in their spare time.  The money raises to build the compounds was from donations.  The UAE also used to have a policy that charities would use at least 50% of their funds on actual projects and not to pay “managers”., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ https://t.co/kwORNGeoZX, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Recruiting, champ.  Maybe do some basic research., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Maybe read the article before posting it 😂 dumb commie, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ https://t.co/eBRlQPr30H, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ How do?  There’s no big right wingers pushing for indoor and outdoor mask mandates or pushing for higher taxes.  I don’t like either party, however, it’s not the Right currently acting authoritarian. It has before in history, but to say that R’s are the tyrants is wrong., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Wow, great outlet in “Mercury News”.  Laughable.  Next, you give me an article from the Washington Post or CNN…, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Then maybe you need to stop\ndriving cars, flying in planes, and using plastics.  Anti-competitive behavior.  It also has the highest cost of living and inflationary rates in the country.  But, don’t let that get in your way of not noticing that Tesla is leaving.  First domino., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ https://t.co/YR2kaz6sn0\n\nTrump and George W pushed for more funding than any of your leftist idiots, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Oh I love California.  Just don’t like your politics or your cities.  Big fan of Napa and St Helena.  Lots of wine and cheese., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Or you could’ve stopped closing the mental institutions. Many in this part of the country, by federal pushing, we’re closed starting with JFK and into LBJ, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ It takes decades for that to build. https://t.co/9QlAlvmqfB, @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ And college football doesn’t know what OU can be?  You must work for the federal government.  Making shit up on a regular basis, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ I see you love AOC.  So, you must be a very intelligent person…laughable.  Pathetic human., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ I don’t disagree on Napa.  Yet, go 1 hour south of there and you have apps showing you maps of where homeless people shit., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Shouldn’t you be worshipping Karl Marx?  Dumb commie, @SquadNation619 @Fight4T @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Maybe Lori Laughlin can make it more clear for the likes of USC recruiting and admissions 😘, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Commies gonna Commie.  Lazy people who think that they are the Intelligentsia, which were still sent to the Gulags.  Maybe Solzhenitsyn was right.  You lefties are too far gone.  Maybe we just need to let you destroy yourselves.  Sad, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Gotta go where the battle is being fought.  Grandparents still\nhad to end the Socialists in Germany and the Imperialists in Japan.  But, don’t let that get in the way of your rant, commie., @SquadNation619 @Fight4T @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Na, I have all my teeth.  It’s the facial scars from the fireworks that got me., @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ At its best?  You mean at its best, while cheating, right?, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Spent years in the UAE.  They built massive compounds for people who were ridiculously uneducated, poor and/or homeless.  In the compound were meals, basic healthcare, a roof, bathroom, showers.  To get this, those people had to show they wanted to work.  Gov contracted them, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ And this proves what?  That leftist politicians can properly manage anything.  Sounds about right., @SquadNation619 @Fight4T @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Ending everything with “you knew that, right” doesn’t make what you say actually true 😂.  Seems the dumbdumbs have united under the USC banner.  Good luck with defending cheating in College Football, champ, @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Then why should 55-19 mean anything to me?  Weirdly hypocritical, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Well, already gave you one, then there’s USC’s issues with sports “recruiting” in general.  Aka, Lori Loughlin.  Others..OJ Mayo, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ https://t.co/yVeSRTCf6E, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ https://t.co/BE1HIXejFu, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Maybe you didn’t read any article…, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ https://t.co/GkWYou66wn, @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ The Soviet Union once did well.  For a short time once fully becoming Communist.  But, go ahead and compare yourselves to them.  Also, China is communist, yet, I wouldn’t want to be a slave.  Especially seeing that the Democrats love slaves.  Had to end many just to stop slavery., @Fight4T @SquadNation619 @CoachBeJackedUp @d1campbell_ Hahahaha, I don’t deny that Big Red Sports and Imports fucked up, leftist twit.  You have a problem admitting anything about the Rubbers. That’s Dr. Dumb Hick to you, bitch 😘]</td>

      <td>[@JimOToole Yep, and I was in that camp to begin with. Got to think differently., @neil_treacy I kind of hear you, but if I see a Bristol No.9 shirt I'm thinking is it Randall, Uren or any of their other half-backs. Squad number just gives instant association. And I can't stress how expensive it is for clubs to have to name shirts 1-15 given how many permutations there are, @PaulWalker1973 Indeed., @AndyD83 And when three other guys then came in at six the next three weeks, and another three came in at seven? Give them each their own number. Much stronger from a recognition standpoint., @ts_edwards Yeah I do remember some early experimentation., @AndyD83 Yes, 1-15 with names is the current system., @AndyD83 @jameswhile My point was just for the Prem., @aapierre I'd still name the team the same way, and it shouldn't be a problem for anyone because the alternative wouldn't be 1 to 15., @jameswhile You've put your point across fairly, and I see what you're saying, but I don't think your casual sports fan is necessarily firmly in the same camp. I'm generalising, of course., @Chris61172903 Exactly. Instinctively I'd say 1-15 with names is best, but for the newby I've been swayed by the squad number argument., @JimOToole Been some fiery responses. I was indtinctively against it but I’ve been won round on balance. I don’t think ‘rugby twiter’ is quite there yet, but they’re not really the target audience on this. More to help draw in some new eyeballs., @DRoj I’d disagree. In open play the roles aren’t the same these days. You get props jackalling, hookers on the wing, back-rowers in backfield to return kicks. Wingers in lineouts. The game’s move on., @KieranFowley I’d disagree there. If I see Saracens 15 and I’m a newby it could be Daly, Mailins, Maitland or others. Give them each their own number and remove the doubt. Plus the added marketing benefits from association with their own specific number., @KieranFowley I disagree. I think squad numbets makes it easier for fans than 1-15. Fan might love the No.14 at one game, comes back next week and someone else is in 14, and last week’s 14 is in 11 or 15., @AndyD83 Ha! 😂, @NikkiJamieson67 At the start of every season you name your squad, with numbers.  Any new player signed after that can be given any free number., @jameswhile @ChaySmith109 @dan_hayward87 I'm not sure a new entrant would have that positional understanding anyway. 'Number 3' would mean as much to them as 'Number 33'. And when a different bloke is wearing '3' at the next game, more confusion. \n\n'Ah I like that 3'. \n\n'No, that's a different bloke to last time'. 🤷‍♂️, @A_D_Jones Just call it ‘loose forward’ instead. Sorted., @DRoj So I see a ‘Quins 2’ shirt. Which player am I thinking of? Currently it could be four or five of them. Give each their own number., @OdysseusNo85 Are they? I think that’s where we differ., @SBungle Yep, all for a polite debate and always useful hearing opposing views., @NeilTunny Not really sure positions matter so much these days to be fair, players are so interchangeable., @KieranStanworth Club shirts aren't single use. My question was specifically Prem., @NickAuger88 But that number would be associated with ONLY that player.\n\nCurrently, a No.9 shirt in my club's colours could mean five different players., @AndyD83 They don’t have to learn the whole squad. They could just say ‘Ooh, Newcastle number 27, I really liked him last time I came’. That’s your entry point., @DRoj You think?\n\nThere's so much variety in teams these days I don't think it's the case that players follow set roles. Some back rowers chase the ball, others hand out in the wide channels, as do some hookers etc. Think the game's moved on from that a bit., @RugbyTimes That was always my school of thought too, Jon, but I have to say I'm coming round to the marketing argument of each player having their own number.\n\nIt'd save the clubs a load of money, if nothing else. But the merchandise and marketing side could really take off., @SBungle Having squad numbers would improve awareness of who the players are, not hinder it. If you see Bristol 9 you’re not thinking is it Randall, Uren or their other half-backs, cos only one player in their entire squad will wear 9., @jameswhile Hmm, not sure I totally agree with that. Positions don't mean as much these days as they once did, and I think there's a strong marketing argument. Elliot Daly could have one number associated with him rather than being a 'maybe 15, maybe 13, maybe 14, maybe 11' for example., @AndyD83 Ha, let’s agree your wife is right!\n\nBeen nice chatting 👍., @Celtic334 Always useful to hear alternative views (for me as well as you)., @Rugby_Marvel If that changes, then that would be another positive outcome., @Chris61172903 Front row players are already nominated on the official team sheet so no extra admin for the clubs., @Chris_Wearmouth Yeah it would have to be league-wide, of course., @LooseheadG That’s certainly one viewpoint shared by a lot of people., @lexieluca22 Presume it'd be too expensive to make all the shirts. You'd need hundreds of extra shirts made for the many permutations., @JimOToole Aye, also means we need to order about 300 fewer shirts each season. Win win!, @Celtic334 They’ve had squad numbers for ages in Super League, seemingly without any problem., @KieranFowley If you’re a newby 15 means as much as 55., @KieranFowley Are ‘serious fans’ the people we should be targeting though? They’re already there and invested in it. The newbies are the guys we need on board., @SBungle I just don’t think a player’s ‘position’ is that relevant any more. Forwards hang out in the back line, backs get into the breakdown. Squad numbers would consistently associate specific players with specific numbers, rather than position, which can change., @Steve_Parrett Exactly, @matt2knight Yep, and absolutely no issue with different views. There's no right and wrong in these things., @AndyD83 Couldn’t disagree more.\n\n‘Oh I really like the Sale number 10’.\n\n‘No, it’s a different 10 to last week’\n\n‘Oh he’s not playing, that’s a shame’\n\n‘No, he’s wearing 13 today, last week’s 12 is in 10 today’ 🤦‍♂️, @KieranFowley I disagree. A newby sees Harlequins 10, ‘yeah I liked him last week’. ‘No, it’s a different guy this week’. Unnecessary barrier imho., @RyanKisiel @Jbeardmore Apologies, written word is not always the easiest to discern sarcasm!, @AndyD83 I take your point, but you’re basically asking non-rugby fans to learn all 15 roles as a starting point. That’s not realistic in this day and age. When last week’s 10 is wearing 12 this week, and 15 is now wearing 13, it’s just an unnecessary barrier., @DRoj Well you’ll be happy with the status quo then and all the inherent barriers (which I accept you don’t see as barriers)., @AndyD83 Fly-halves regularly stand at ‘fullback’ during the kick battles, or defend on the blindside wing. This notion of hard and fast positions just doesn’t exist to anywhere near the same degree., @SBungle If you’re new to rugby you most likely don’t know what a 9 is or does, and the scrum-half is pretty easy to spot as they’re the one feeding the scrum and passing/kicking from the base of each ruck, whatever number is on their back., @GilbertGreen64 @KeeneTiger Same place they currently are., @SJCruise23 We had four Wilsons in the team for one game 😂, @JohnHX2 I was intrinsically against it for the same reason to be fair, but I've been talked round., @KieranFowley Basically on current viewing numbers pro rugby doesn’t work, so we need to grow the audience. Instantly associating star players with their squad numbers is an easy ‘in’ to that group in my opinion., @jameswhile Other than rugby league and football I don't really know of any sports which have moved from a standard numbering system to a squad number system, but I don't think it's been detrimental to those that have made the switch., @NickAuger88 Your 'main' players are of course most likely to have those numbers, eg in football your main centre forward is still generally 9, your playmaker is 10, your keeper is 1 etc. Obviously there are exceptions., @RugbyTimes You're in a significant minority there, I'd say., @DRoj How would it be a nightmare?\n\nYou'd still have 15 players on each team and one number associated with each player.\n\nIf anything it'd be easier knowing in advance what number a specific player is going to be wearing?, @AJFHudson All fair points. I'm not saying there's a right and wrong answer., @GD10 My thinking exactly. I was very 'anti' at the start but I've been won over., @AlexFerentinos7 They do it in Super League and it seems to work fine., @KieranFowley Concise!, @RugbyTimes Bet you know what number Michael Jordan wore, though, even if you don't know what position he played., @gatwardian Well this would save the clubs a load of money cos they'd need to order far fewer shirts, so you'd actually be helping them financially., @jameswhile No worries, James. We keep being told to grow the game and make club rugby more marketable to people who currently aren't regular fans. I think this has the potential to do it from a merchandise and player ID perspective, but totally understand traditionalists not being on board., @QuinsFOTS @KieranFowley Not sure how that solves anything, and arms are already maxed out with sponsor and league patches., @BS3Alex @experiencelight Exactly., @Chris61172903 Or that awful basketball player wearing 23!, @KieranFowley If Daly wears 4 different numbers in 4 different games, as opposed to one number in those same games, then it’s harder to immediately identify him. Also opens up merchandise options., @NeilTunny I'm not so sure. Back-five forwards are pretty hybrid these days, as are outside backs., @KieranFowley My proposal is squad numbers with names, yes., @AndyD83 @SJCruise23 @aj_d___ @DRoj I’d stil have the name. I just think a ‘positional marker’ is less relevant cos roles have changed so much, and a lot of newbies won’t know the 1-15 roles anyway., @RugbyTimes Ask 20 sports fans what number Michael Jordan wore, and I'll bet you more than half know the answer., @oliverstedman Get your philosophical point but just think things have moved on from that., @KeeneTiger They do it in Super League and it works well. It's save the clubs thousands, and I can actually see a positive marketing angle to it. I wasn't on board initially but I am coming round to the idea., @DickieJev You think?\n\nI watch it in the rugby league and it doesn't affect my enjoyment at all., @JimOToole 100%. Let’s see a ‘Radwan45’ range in the club shop, or from his boot sponsor., @AJFHudson The shirts are all blank, you add the number and name on as you need them, so that's not really an issue., @RorySkis If you see an England No.10 shirt, which player is associated with it?\n\nMarcus Smith or Owen Farrell.\n\nIt's not quite clear, is it.\n\nI'm only suggesting it for the club game, but I think the same argument applies., @AndyD83 Yes yoy can do that, but seems sub-optimal to me., @AJFHudson It's things like back-five forwards having to have named shirts made up in numbers 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and back-line players having shirts with 11, 14, 15 and 13 in some cases. Multiply that by a whole squad and it becomes an expensive exercise making all these shirts up., @jameswhile Not dismissing your point, but I don't see 1-15 as being significantly stronger from a marketing point of view.\n\nIf I see an 'England 10' shirt who am I associating it with?\n\nFarrell or Smith?, @KieranFowley I think the game’s moved on these days, players cover a number of roles. Back-rowers are in the backfield receiving kicks, props are jackalling at ruck time etc. 1-15 means a lot less now than it once did., @Chris61172903 I don't think positions are such a big thing these days compared to how they used to be. Personally don't see that as an issue., @AndyD83 @SJCruise23 @aj_d___ @DRoj Same as when a different striker plays in football with a different shirt number. Having six players wearing number 4 in the same season is surely more confusing than the alternative., @experiencelight Just means having to label far fewer shirts., @neil_treacy The amount of shirts we have to name and number each season is honestly insane, for guys who play more than one position., @KieranFowley Haha, indeed. Been nice chatting though. Have a good weekend., @PhilJ0606 I personally don't think that's a good enough reason not to do it. I'm not in favour of refs coaching in that way anyway to be honest. If a player has hands on when they shouldn't, give the penalty and it'll put them off doing it next time., @KieranStanworth Fair point, @AndyD83 I see from your bio you’re an NFL fan. Would you be in favour of all quarterbacks wearing the same number, say 7? So Tom Brady wears 7, he gets injured. His deputy plays the next game wearing 7, has a bad game, the next week a third guy comes in in 7. I can’t see it taking off., @RyanKisiel @Jbeardmore No, I don't see that as growing the game, personally. Probably the opposite., @JimOToole “I like that Newcastle number 14”.\n\n“No, that’s a different guy. Last week’s 14 is today’s 11, last week’s 11 is today’s 15. Last week’s 13 is wearing 12 today” 🤪, @NickAuger88 You wouldn't have to. Only 15 are allowed on the field at any one time., @AndyD83 The old notion of ‘position’ is a bit of a misnomer these days, bar the set piece. And even then, ‘number 8’ will often defend at blindside flank, for example., @AndyD83 Needing to label fewer shirts. Hundreds in fact., @jameswhile You think? What reason?\n\nI was in your camp, to be fair, but am coming round to the idea from a marketing perspective. It'd certainly save the clubs a lot of money at a time when we could really do with that., @AndyD83 @DRoj Hookers would still be in the middle of the scrum with squad numbers., @experiencelight I hear you to some extent, but we keep being told that growing the game revolves around building the players' profiles and marketability, and this is a way of doing that.\n\nI was originally devil's advocate, but I am coming round to it., @KieranFowley They already have those., ...]</td>

AGAIN, There was ZERO incentive for the VA REPS to stuff product on the shelf, and EVERY reason for PP, 5LL and Co. to have them do so.

The VA reps didn’t get PAID until the grafts were implanted although the company recognized the revenue at the time it shipped.

I mean honestly - give your head a shake. \n\nThere's absolutely 0 evidence to warrant this level of panic and fear. Have you really been this dialled up for 2 years? That's gotta be worse than getting covid. 😬, @metromorning I trust the science of vaccine efficacy. People are welcome to continue wearing masks indefinitely. Nobody's stopping them.

Hospital? Yes - absolutely. \n\nBut while you're being seated at a restaurant? Come on., @univrsle @the_nita @metromorning So everybody should stay home?, @Rophdofr @metromorning Or possibly the pro-science, pro-vaxxers who believe in the science of vaccine efficacy. \n\nScience says we can take them off.

All those conspiracies that show how vaccines are effective. 👍, @CascadeTessa @univrsle @metromorning I also argue that it's selfish to keep forcing people to wear a mask just to "feel comfortable" -- that's nuts to me.

Why is this such a shock for you people?, @univrsle @CascadeTessa @metromorning I find it hilarious that the people who want the province to buckle to their unfounded fears have the audacity to call others "selfish" - especially when you're asking people to continue perpetuating your own selfish delusions., @JoCro42 @canmd1971 @metromorning If you run into traffic and you get hit, the onus is on you for running into traffic. \n\nIf you are immunocompromised, 900lbs and 85 years old, the onus is on you to take steps to protect yourself as you're riddled with co-morbidities., @RogueRoyalle Says you. \n\nYou're welcome to stay home but it's selfish to expect others to live in your fear bubble., @CascadeTessa @univrsle @metromorning For now and forever. \n\nI went to Texas in October where I went to a racetrack with 400,000 people. No masks. Totally packed. 3 covid tests, all negative. \n\nParty in December with hundreds - maskless - no outbreaks.\n\nVaccines work. 👍, @CascadeTessa @univrsle @metromorning And the CDC is staffed by a bunch of quacks., @LegendaryNoize @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning Well all these scientists keep coming out in favor of dropping mask mandates due to the fact that vaccines are effective and masks are *checks notes* ... not., @canmd1971 @metromorning Totally your choice to assess your personal risks and go from there. \n\nIt's selfish to force everyone to live in your bubble of unfounded fear., @CascadeTessa @univrsle @metromorning Hardly a gamble given the survivability of covid. Especially considering I have 3 doses of Moderna swimming around in my system., @univrsle @metromorning Which numbers? The rapidly declining hospitalizations? Those ones? I think that's what's guiding the decision 🤔🤔🤔, @univrsle @the_nita @metromorning This may shock you but nobody is stopping you from wearing all the masks you want and assessing risks for yourself and your loved ones. \n\nIt's simply acknowledging that 90% of mask wearing is pure theatrics., @LegendaryNoize @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning So vaccines work? Glad we agree. \n\nAnd masks obviously were so good at preventing the spread, it's why nobody got covid thanks to mask mandates. .... Oh wait a sec. Yes they did. \n\nCDC, de Villa also saying to drop masks. And they don't work for the province., @JoCro42 @canmd1971 @metromorning Well fortunately those rules are changing on March 21. 👍, @CascadeTessa @girlpublisher @alvo_alvotech @metromorning Very!, @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning Well you'd have to leave your hermetically sealed bunker for that to happen. And based on how afraid of the world you are, doesn't sound like that's gonna happen anytime soon., @Rophdofr @EMBEAnthony @metromorning @SickKidsNews Looks like those mask mandates didn't do much for those 6 million people, eh? \n\nIf a mask doesn't filter out a fart, it's not filtering out Covid., @girlpublisher @alvo_alvotech @metromorning Sounds like you should "Stay at Home" based on your little graphic. \n\nNo mention here of the efficacy of vaccines. 👀, @canmd1971 @JoCro42 @ThomasAaronBru1 @metromorning Maybe. But I'm not wrong. 🤷‍♂️, @EMBEAnthony @Rophdofr @metromorning @SickKidsNews But not banned, right? So you're still free to wrap Timmy in bubble wrap and slap 20 masks on his face all you want., @univrsle @metromorning Also it was never all 4 of those things. \n- handwashing, yes - but surface sanitization pointless\n- it was always masks OR distance - "both" was never the recommendation and it's the fear mongerers that got us to that. \n- vaccines trump all. \n\nThat was always the message., @RogueRoyalle Nope. I trust the efficacy of vaccines. 👍, @Rophdofr @EMBEAnthony @metromorning @SickKidsNews Meanwhile hospitalizations continue to decline........... \n\nI don't understand why the "trust the science" crew doesn't *trust the science of vaccine efficacy* and would rather drag the entire province into their unfounded fear fest., @univrsle @the_nita @metromorning That's a massive leap and you know it. You're drunk on fear., @EMBEAnthony @Rophdofr @metromorning @SickKidsNews @fordnation Waiting for hospitalizations to spike like..... https://t.co/ar3Ewqb4H5, @bpdoulas @metromorning And what about restaurants? Can't catch covid when you're eating, obviously. \n\nSame thing on a plane. Masks on unless you're eating or drinking. I guess it's a different cylinder of recycled air at that point?\n\nIt's theatrics., @univrsle @CascadeTessa @metromorning So are you suggesting we wait til we're COVID-0? Not going to happen. 🤷‍♂️\n\nWe also have had mask mandates for two years and, per your panic-stricken tweet, we had "ALMOST 1000 DEATHS LAST MONTH".\n\nOnce again, nobody's stopping you from wearing 40 masks and a hazmat suit., @bpdoulas @metromorning Removing the mask mandate *is* common sense. Seeing as it's absolute nonsense to have it in the first place., @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning You're still welcome to live in your illusion/delusion of "safety" by wearing a useless piece of fabric on your face. I'm not forcing you to take it off. \n\nBut forcing people to wear masks (especially in gyms, restaurants, etc) is forcing people to live in your deluded reality., @univrsle @metromorning Except, of course, by the scientists at the CDC which said masks are unnecessary if you're fully vaccinated. \n\nAnd coming soon, by Dr Moore, scientist, who will say the same thing. \n\nBut go on about how science has never confirmed this. 🤔, @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning I did. What'd I miss? The part where they say you can wear one if you want to? Or the part that says we're at a dramatically different point in the pandemic now? \n\nBoth of which totally reinforce exactly what I've been saying., @LegendaryNoize @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning There's no evidence to suggest high levels of hospitalizations... In fact, the opposite is true.\n\n If there are actually 20,000 new cases per day as has been suggested, the rapidly declining hospitalization numbers show that vaccines are effective., @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning I will do me. That's the point of these mandates dropping. \n\nAgain, it's a dropping of mandates, not a ban on masks. You're free to wear a mask and a hazmat suit and wipe your groceries down. Nobody's stopping you. \n\nBut you can't force me to live in your fear bubble., @Rophdofr @EMBEAnthony @metromorning @SickKidsNews Stop treating mortality like it's breaking news. \n\nThe Spanish Flu stopped killing people when it ran out of people to kill., @metromorning It's silly to think that masks are effective at "preventing the spread" at a place like the gym - were mandates require you to wear a mask between workouts at the gym, meanwhile you can remove it to huff and puff on the treadmill under the giant fans..... 🙄, @RogueRoyalle So when you go to a restaurant and wear a mask to go from the door to a table but then take the mask off, what's the point?\n\nSame for the gym, movies, airplanes. All pointless to have masks that get taken off 3 minutes later., @LegendaryNoize @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning CDC is American, de Villa works for the city of Toronto, not the province. \n\nSorry that this doesn't fit your conspiracy narrative. Sorry that you don't trust the efficacy of vaccines. Sorry that you're a victim of your own fear. \n\nSad, really. But again, you can wear 30 masks., @EMBEAnthony @Rophdofr @metromorning @SickKidsNews @fordnation People are free to wear all the masks they want. The idea that my lack of mask has any effect is actually delusional.\n\n*Panders, not 'ponders', @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning And again, NOBODY, I repeat NOBODY is stopping you from wearing all the masks you want. Go for it. I hope you *feel* safe. Seeing as *feelings* are about the only thing masks seem to protect these days., @bpdoulas @metromorning So you DO see the ridiculous theatrics but have no response. Coooool beans. 👍\n\n#WhyYoureAKaren, @univrsle @the_nita @metromorning Ah yes, the science that says that you can't catch covid on a treadmill so you can take your mask of there. Or when you're eating in a restaurant - so it's ok to remove your mask there. \n\nThis is a performance at this point. I trust the science that says vaccines work., @bpdoulas @metromorning Do you not see the ridiculousness of wearing masks for theatrics only to take them off to function? Eg: eat, drink, treadmill.\n\nHow does wearing a mask between workouts do anything if you don't have to wear one when you huff and puff on the treadmill? \n\nIt's theatrics., @univrsle @metromorning Alternatively: trusting the science of vaccine efficacy., @LegendaryNoize @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning So Moore was a hero when he announced another shutdown in Jan but now he's a hack? Got it. \n\nThe CDC, De Villa also recommending masks come off. \n\n"Checks notes" is common internet slang. \n\nThe metrics being tracked are the plummetting hospitalizations... Because vaccines work., @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning Glad you brought up restaurants to highlight the ridiculousness of masks: required when being seated, but not when sitting and shovelling your face full of food. Because you can't catch covid when you're eating, right?\n\nRidiculous., @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning How so? By not wearing a mask? I'm not stopping you from wearing 20 of them. It's an end to mask mandates, not a ban on masks. \n\nI trust the science of vaccine efficacy. 👍, @LegendaryNoize @_Lindsay__ @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning Well lots of people dismissing Moore because he's "a political hack" so figured I should clarify that the scientific recommendations to drop masks are widespread and beyond Ontario., @univrsle @Pinchy63 @metromorning We're there. If you decide that you're not, there's nothing stopping you from wearing a mask. \n\nBut you've got no right to impose your fears on others., @Pinchy63 @univrsle @metromorning Babies? With their hyper adaptive immune systems?\n\nAlso, at this point, babies should be protected by their mother's vaccination status. If you're giving birth without being vaccinated at this point, what are you even doing??, @bpdoulas @girlpublisher @alvo_alvotech @metromorning Gee. Almost as if it was created for a population that wasn't 90% vaccinated. \n\nThe landscape has changed, Karen., @CascadeTessa @univrsle @metromorning I mean I'm frustrated that so many of our citizens deny the efficacy of vaccines and seem to want this pandemic and it's myriad of shutdowns and ass backwards policies to last forever. \n\nIt's ridonkulous that the vocal minority is keeping us trapped because they're so afraid., @CascadeTessa @univrsle @metromorning I will do me. That's kinda the point of removing these pointless mandates. \n\nAlso, for someone who thinks I'm a big conspiracy theorist, you sure did retweet half my timeline. 🤔]</td>

What's your point? Do you believe there are expolanets around distant stars? If so, why? Have you looked at the raw data?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner But you said "amended".

What's your explanation for that increase?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Now you've just started eating crayons.

The IPCC has no budget to fund scientific research., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Evidence. It's "evidence". Not "evident". And why have you capitalised "carbon"? And I think you mean "carbon dioxide"., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner You're actually struggling to give a cogent answer, aren't you? Or are you on the verge of embarrassing yourself?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Again, I ask if you are aware what "proof" means in scientific discourse., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Point 1: the IPCC describes the human influence on climate change as "unequivocal", @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner All data I've given you has been dismissed as "not the right kind of data". There's plainly nothing that would even hypothetically allow you to change your view on anything. That's the very antithesis of the scientific method., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner It's quite entertaining to see you realise you've made a grave error of understanding, then retreat into monosyllabic replies like a toddler to avoid having to face the fact that you've messed up so royally. I'm proud that I've not descended into rudeness, sarcasm and abuse., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Oh I see. You wrote "blue pulled". Perhaps English prose construction/spelling is not one of your qualifications?, @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner No, I genuinely do not know why you keep posting that graph from NTSLF and clearly accept it, yet don't accept the MetOffice analysis., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Point 4: "Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected \nto increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C." (IPCC), @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner And I honestly don't know what LFT stands for in this context., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner I disagree, frankly. The word "cult" is loaded and you yourself are using it in an attempt at denigration., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Ah yes, I recall now. What exactly is "asinine" about that tweet?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner My original reply to you was in response to this post of yours: "“Acceleration sea level rise”?? You do realise that just making shit up &amp;amp; posting it on Twatter doesn’t make it true, don’t you?" Your post was rude, illiterate, misquoted the original poster and sarcastic., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Deletion is not a necessary feature of an amendment. It might be, but you've provided no evidence that that is what happened., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner To suggest that I wish to "destroy the lives of billions" is silly and illogical. Of course I don't., @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner Do you mean "have I read the report carefully?", or do you mean "have I interrogated the raw data on which the report is based?", @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner OK now you've switched to debating opinions on action, not debating rational science. I'm not prepared to open a new front, frankly., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Point 3: not within IPCC's mandate, but I think you'll agree that significant change from current conditions brings costs (and potentially benefits), @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Oh dear oh dear. You're descending rapidly into solipsism., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Who is proposing "altering the sun"?, @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner So you're saying we have emitted so much CO2 as a species *because* the world has got warmer? The well-known "warming before CO2" issue is easily explained by Milankovitch cycles being the main driver of Ice Ages beginning to end. But you'll know that from 5th grade chemistry., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner I provided you with point-by-point evidence in answer to your four questions earlier. You simply denied that such evidence was admissible, apparently because it didn't fit with your views, which appear inflexible.

Genuinely don't understand., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Hilarious. Please state your relevant academic credentials, and I'll state mine. You seem to confuse "thinking" with rational debate. If I "think" about UFOs it doesn't make them real. Also, I don't know what "blue pulled" means., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Once again, you deflect from a perfectly reasonable question., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner The article is about sea level in a British context.

Answer: no., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner OK, so are “Deniers of anthropogenic global warming” a cult?, @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner Right - it was an ANALOGY. Now, why do you insist on my inspecting raw data on sea level before you'll believe it, whereas that w outlander apply to exoplanets or (say) a finding about thr population of fish in the deep ocean?

I genuinely don't know what it means, and I'm interested., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner You actually, seriously don't think human activity had had ANY impact on climate change?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Er... it's entirely congruent. What makes you think it isn't?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Hilarious self own., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner The use of the term "cult" is equally absurd, since it encourages comparison with dangerous and malign religious organisations.

Not a good look., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Where's the raw data you've used to construct that graph? I suspect its only a model., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner You think the IPCC reports are "opinion pieces" now?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner So you're happy to be called a member of the “deniers of anthropogenic global warming cult”?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner But you are also wrong: "The IPCC ...was set up by the WMO and UNEP to prepare, based on available scientific information, assessments on all aspects of climate change and its impacts, with a view of formulating realistic response strategies.", @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner You are right. The IPCC conducts no original scientific research...., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Would you say that "Climate Deniers" constituted a cult?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner The problem was that you didn't like the SOURCE of my evidence, so you simply rejected it. Fine, your choice., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Excellent copy and paste skills there. Seriously, why can't you just debate politely with people?, @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner Yes I've seen that graph you're so keen on. So much so that it was the tweet of yours I replied to. Now try and find the time in your busy schedule actually to read the report., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Incorrect, but I have no more patience with your prejudgments of others' views. It appears that there is nothing that would even hypothetically cause you to adapt your opinions, which by definition means you are closed of mind and incapable of redemption.

Try again. I want you to state very specifically what YOU think is wrong with my tweet., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner "The article is about sea level in a British context. Globally, in toto, sea level rise is occurring too. But in some places, it is falling." That's what I said, and stand by. You say there's something wrong with it, but aren't brave enough to say what. Who's the fool?, @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner Can I see the raw data you have used to construct that graph, please, and also the precise numerical analysis technique you have used. You're not seriously saying that data analysis should be "by eye"?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Has global temperature increased since (say) 1850? Yes. Are humans significantly responsible? Yes. Facts accepted by the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, but not by you. Doesn't make them false., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Serious question: why do you doubt that the Mer Office's findings are true?, @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Hahaha you're so clever making an amusing joke based on my name!, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Which question would you like me to answer?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner You're getting so angry. Need a sit down? I simply suggested that religious cults can be dangerous to their members and their families. You really disagree?, @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner You keep telling yourself that. The void is listening., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Point 2: "The evidence is clear that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change." (IPCC), @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner So not "deleted" then. Just updated to reflect the latest understanding of the various historical factors affecting data reliability., @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner Nice bit of avoiding the question there. It's what we call an "analogy". Please answer the question?, @aNorthernGarden @CharlieJGardner And so he progesses to personal insult. I'm asking you for the source data, just as you challenged me to do for the Met Office report. Why do you accept secondary data from the NTSLF, but not the Met Office? I'm genuinely perplexed., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner I'm actually not sure you know how science works., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner In isolation, it isn't evidence of AGW., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner I think you're just struggling to accept that all evidence is evidence, but that you just want to put your fingers in your ears if you don't like a particular piece of evidence. https://t.co/qyUix63Wnw, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner That's what I just said. Can you point out my error, please?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner It's always worth checking your work before handing it in., @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner I'm actually starting to feel a bit sorry for you., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Your level of cortisol appears to be rising. "Illiterate" means you're not very good at writing English. Where did I make a specific comment about localised sea level rise, remind me?, @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner "A movement held together by a shared commitment to an ideology.", @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner Re your Bigfoot "analogy" - do you know what constitutes "proof" in science?, @GregShephard1 @ReddirtF @PrussianRemnant @CharlieJGardner Would @ReddirtF's dad lose to yours in a fight, too? Does his mum smell? You're really struggling here., @GregShephard1 @CharlieJGardner The main driver of sea level rise is thermal expansion of existing sea water. Please continue.]</td>

But I do need to laugh when you call me a bitch and then complain that I insulted you. \n\nAnd if you can compete in "the arena of ideas," you can answer a simple question without dodging. \n\nOr not., @1FJB11 @JD_ForTheWin @GrowingOutrage @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse Sorry, were you for or against paying for a loan? You seem confused.\n\nYes, I'm sure you "woke up," April 2022 account made of random alphanumerics. Well done, you're following the script better than Olivier., @SteetcherBucket @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse Alrighty, now you're just lying. I've given you several citations in this thread, now you can give me one that proves "all of the media" and "all big tech CEOs hate Trump." \n\nStart with, let's say, Newsmax,, @Gwyllim1 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse What a long-winded way to say "I can't." \n\nDemocrats don't have a problem with government helping people. Neither do Republicans...unless it's the "wrong" people.\n\nBye now., @dung_win @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse So many fluffy, airy buzzwords, and you managed to say...what was your word? Ah yes, "crickets." \n\nWhen Trump says "the people," he means "me." When he says "fake news," he means "facts I don't like." \n\nCome back if you need any more information the rest of us knew 7 years ago., @St24451533 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse You gonna point out what's uncivil in this tweet, March account with a string of random letters and numbers, or dodge the question again?, @muchos_grande @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse "How is 'enemy of the people' political?" \n\nI'm just gonna let you sit and ruminate on that one., @dung_win @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse Wow, dismissing a stranger and confirming your own bias before you finish the tweet. That might be a record. \n\n"Enemy of the people" is a phrase Trump used to direct MAGA cult violence towards his personal enemies. You have my condolences for your memory issues., @Dontwor49199898 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse I wasn't aware Nancy Pelosi had pitched a hissy-fit over student loan forgiveness. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong., @chriswithans @JonAnderso24601 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse And also once again: the government JUST gave away hundreds of billions of dollars to wealthy business owners. A gift that the GOP directly enabled by gutting oversight. \n\nAnd you're complaining that we're helping students saddled with a lifetime of debt. Nope. \n\nNope., @Dontwor49199898 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse A procedural dispute. Never heard her say anything about student loan forgiveness being "unfair." \n\nThe rest of your whataboutism looks pretty silly while you worship a man awaiting multiple felony charges under the Espionage Act., @monkeybeanpie @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse One, I don't see any attack here. I see a statement of fact.\n\nYour distaste for that fact is a you problem, not a policy problem. \n\nAnd two, Trump constantly used the White House Twitter to attack his political opponents. No imagination necessary. \n\nhttps://t.co/YjF1K2G8gB, @chriswithans @JonAnderso24601 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse If it's not my money, then it's not yours, either. \n\nIf government works for the people, it works for the poor ones too, not just the ones who can buy their own laws., @atcontino @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse So you don't actually want to see democrats who received PPP loans.

That's how a child (or a cultist) thinks. \n\nBut I recognize your deep, childish need for the last word, and I invite you to indulge it:, @patriotesse @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse I think it's extremely rude and infantile to answer a question with a question. It demonstrates that you don't actually have an answer. \n\nBut since you bring it up, only about a third of the free PPP money actually went to workers. https://t.co/lJj9g3L49w \n\nHow much did you keep?, @MsPanda007 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse Once again, I must ask you to show me a democrat bitching about student loan forgiveness. Then we can check if they took out PPP loans. \n\nThe MAGA cult is 0 for 2 on this one. Think you can break the streak?, @SteetcherBucket @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse I don't know why you're repeatedly lying. \n\nOh, wait, I do: it's because you can't make any points with the truth.\n\nHave a nice day, cultist. If you feel the childish need to get in the last word, once again skipping citations, feel free to do so now., @SuspendMyAssHoe @JustTheTipMatt @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse Amazing.

Or the truth that you've been deflecting to subjects like Pelosi and an unelected citizen since the start, and never once mentioned any lack of civility in the original tweet? \n\nThose truths?, @chriswithans @JonAnderso24601 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse When the US is already one of the most tax-permissive countries on the planet, and billionaires lobby directly to abdicate their fair share, it's absolutely a giveaway. \n\nWith a bow, a kiss, and a happy ending. \n\nOnce again: don't bitch about student loans., @St24451533 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse MAGA cultists sure seem to be allergic to answering extremely simple questions.\n\n"No." The answer you meant to give was "No, I'm not going to point out anything uncivil in the tweet." \n\nAlternately, "Yes, I'm going to dodge the question again.", @patriotesse @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse I can say only one thing for sure: people who got hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions in free money, and had the opportunity to straight-up steal most of it, probably shouldn't complain when middle-class people get the government assistance they take for granted., @1FJB11 @JD_ForTheWin @GrowingOutrage @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse "YOUR cult calls for violence, destruction, and murder. Nice." \n\nhttps://t.co/RiN3SF5RXy\n\nEnjoy your facts., @SteetcherBucket @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse Weird that Zuckerberg allowed conservative media to bypass restrictions on anti-vaccine and conspiracy posts. \n\nhttps://t.co/VVJJyvJRCM\n\nAnd that Dorsey wouldn't filter racists... because they act too much like Republicans. \n\nhttps://t.co/nLyq26m7Ym, @SteetcherBucket @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse But since you compared them, you can answer my next question: why does a millionaire deserve more help from the government by an order of magnitude, than a nurse who's been helping people for decades and only accrued interest on their education?\n\nWhere did those bootstraps go?, @JonAnderso24601 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse No, they didn't. They put that money in their pocket, which you'd know if you had used this week-long gap to read the article. \n\nSince you couldn't answer my previous questions, try this one: are you a liar or just an idiot?, @1FJB11 @JD_ForTheWin @GrowingOutrage @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse I didn't say anything about bots. But it's the first conclusion you jumped to. Way to think for yourself. \n\nSorry you got duped by another nutty billionaire, cultist. It seems to be a recurring theme., @chriswithans @rayneblanc @JonAnderso24601 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse So "you" issued EV tax credits, but "we" gave $2 trillion overwhelmingly to the richest people in the country. You're okay with enriching billionaires, who last time I checked, don't buy $30K Teslas.\n\nhttps://t.co/Z6Fux4eKIy\n\nI mean this with complete sincerity: fuck right off., @chriswithans @rayneblanc @JonAnderso24601 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse It is, however you'd like to pretend that it isn't. \n\nAnd since we're incurring debt anyway, I'm much happier to help graduates making less than $125K, than billionaires lobbying for all of us to pay the bills they can so clearly already afford., @SteetcherBucket @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse "Yeah in the short term it may help some people." \n\nTens of millions of people. After taxpayers "helped" millionaires pocket billions of dollars in loans with no oversight. \n\nApples and oranges, I suppose., @patriotesse @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse It's really no wonder that there was so much fraud and theft. Trump, life-long fraud and thief, gutted the oversight of the program. \n\nhttps://t.co/h6M19rA7O0\n\nHow badly was it run? Who knows. Because there was such bad oversight., @Dontwor49199898 @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse So, are you going to show me where the original tweet strayed from any kind of facts, into the previously well-trodden territory of "nasty woman" et al? \n\nOr are you going to continue with "your types'" usual whataboutism list?, @SteetcherBucket @Joelmpetlin @WhiteHouse I didn't see anyone with a gun to their head forced to take  PPP loans.\n\nOr the money they were allowed to pocket thanks to Trump demanding a lack of oversight.\n\nhttps://t.co/SRosGqgnoo\n\nIf you get help, don't bitch about others getting help.

I think that formula is wrong, but you know what I mean!), @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I’m talking about what exists today. Agree big claims made for Eth2 but 1) it doesn' yet exist &amp;amp; 2) I don’t understand the active work on its consensus mechanism. Hence my point about maybe being wrong about “permissionless always means probabilistic”. Maybe V&amp;amp;co have solved that, @AndrewDARMACAP @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @asangoio @CollinCusce @Cordablockchain @PegaSysEng Ouch... You make @goquorum sound like a total dead-end… With friends like that…, @jwolpert @rickcrook @_JohnWhelan @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain And when it comes to getting a neutral external opinion on transaction ordering, the debate nets down to: would I rather get that opinion from five anonymous Chinese mining operators or a set of well-known, public organisations with reputations to protect?, @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I have a valid, signed, timestamped and notarised tx. So there are (in your hypothetical example) signatures from at least three identified consensus participants (actually - probably 4 but go with it for simplicity)., @asangoio @jwolpert @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain It’s nothing to do with hard forks. It’s to do with confirmed transactions being at perpetual risk of getting reversed as an intrinsic and inevitable consequence of how PoW works., @AndrewDARMACAP @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @Cordablockchain That’s fair… but it does feel kinda disappointing to realise there was a missing asterisk at the bottom of every mainnet-integration pitch for the last year: “* note”: none of this will actually work until a complete redesign of the underlying platform is finished. Maybe.”, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain … but the assumptions under which the “negligible probability” argument works don’t actually hold. So we should acknowledge permissionless networks put you at risk of being somebody’s mark - and you’ll have no recourse. “Sucks to be you” /2, @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Isn’t it the *key* point? If the assumption fails in permissionless setting, it’s effectively nobody’s fault.. it just sucks to be the loser who was just double-spent against. If it fails in a permissioned world, you know _precisely_ who to sue. That’s the heart of it (I think!), @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain In particular, do you have a link to your last example? My handwaving only goes as fas as “if you don’t know the denominator how can you reason with certainty about whether you’ve seen enough votes”., @jwolpert @christo4ferris @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Agree!, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain We might need to switch roles on this one… your ambition seems too *small*! I _want_ to run shared business logic with my peers… market-level business processes and apps are the next frontier in transforming the economics of entire industries, no?, @_JohnWhelan @asangoio @jwolpert @AndrewDARMACAP @danoprey @rickcrook @CollinCusce @Cordablockchain I don’t know… I did my fair share of bitcoin payments back in the day… :-p, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I fear *you're* now the one employing jedi mind tricks :) The "probability a specific tx won't be reversed is (1-epsilon)^n" argument only works if you assume a diverse non-colluding set of miners. But what's the justification for such an assumption for any given tx of interest?, @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I’m not yet convinced that’s accurate btw…, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain My “mark” comment was intended to put a sharp point on how a targeted tx-reversal could be pulled anywhere but in permissionless world it would be indistinguishable from bad luck, whereas in the permissioned world, you would 1) know you had been screwed and 2) who did it to you., @jwolpert @AndrewDARMACAP @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @rickcrook @CollinCusce @Cordablockchain Fair… and I actually had a few other high profile people in mind when I wrote that :), @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain My point was: it’s not the technology that’s the hard part. It’s the business side of things. And which network type you deploy to doesn’t change that. Except if that network has no identity infra and no finality, you have *extra* problems to deal with, not fewer., @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain That would be awesome. I think the key ‘out-trade’ to use that horrible phrase is this: “I'm willing to give up a lot of speed (latency, time to finality up to some limit in minutes or even hours)” https://t.co/oiY4AI5joV.  The problem is that there *is* no limit, right?, @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain No. The question is: what happens WHEN ordering becomes “reordered” (equivalently: when confirmed transactions become unconfirmed.) Are you running on a system where you know who’s at fault? Or are you running on a system where you’re just expected to suck it up?, @jwolpert @CollinCusce @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain yeah - so I guess the remaining question is exactly what’s coming in Eth2. If it will offer permissionless guaranteed finality, we can all be happy. If not, then it comes down to worldview as you say I guess?, @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Would that it were so, though…. ie to reason about epsilon’s value you need to know things (eg composition of mining pools) that you can’t actually know.  That term isn’t small just _because_ it’s labelled epsilon, right? :), @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain That would be great… will you/others be in HK or SG for the FinTech events in the coming weeks?, @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Or maybe my argument is right but there’s a good argument for why it doesn’t matter. If so, that too would be interesting. But without a written argument either way (or for some third position), I just don’t get the whole ‘anchor in mainnet’ thing., @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I’m not a consensus PhD so entirely possible my simplistic explanation in this piece (https://t.co/Nr8aFPnqz3) is wrong. If so, where is there a good write-up that shows how a permissionless chain can provide finality? Like I say, if there was one I could use, I would be a buyer., @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Try as I might, I struggle to get comfortable with pitching “put your faith in what might turn out to be a consensus system run by five guys in the same country and over whom you have zero recourse if something bad happens”…, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain The thing is: this may all be fine… with the downsides of probabilistic finality also come upsides for some use-cases (eg censorship resistance). But we should acknowledge both sides of the argument.  /3, @jwolpert @christo4ferris @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I must admit I just tune out whenever I hear somebody talk about "web3" but if it's *not* an attempt to rearchitect the WWW, what on earth *is* it?!, @asangoio @jwolpert @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain But Vitalik’s piece makes my point for me, right? He states (correctly, I _think_ - I am not a consensus PhD) that permissionlessness implies prob. finality and points out that you have to make unverifiable assumptions about the mining pool to put bounds on those probabilities., @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Remember that podcast we did where I said something like: "give me finality and I'm a buyer!" More here https://t.co/Nr8aFPnqz3 Net-net: I need to understand why "permisionlessness implies probabilistic finality" is wrong. If it *is* wrong, great... we're off to the races!, @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain We obviously speak to different clients :)  Agree no software is perfect… my point is about designing systems where, when something inevitably goes wrong, you can clearly assign blame., @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain I mean: if your specific argument held, to be consistent you’d have to also call for the sunsetting of Quorum, Autonity, AxCore, and shutting down the EEA, no?, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain But even if we restrict attention to a base “ordering” layer, I still can’t get my head around why I’d use one in which arbitrary _reorderings_ could happen as a natural consequence of its design and where, if it happened, I could’t even know if somebody was even at fault., @CollinCusce @danoprey @asangoio @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain That's exactly my point, right?, @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Sure (and thank you). But surely that’s all we *can* argue about. That’s what exists. That’s what those arguing for maninnet integration/reliance are telling people to rely on surely?, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain A PoW chain can reorg _arbitrarily many blocks deeply_ at any time. Transactions that were included beforehand can be replaced by conflicting transactions in the new chain. If it happens to *my* transaction I don't know if I am unlucky or a targeted victim. It just sucks to be me, @jwolpert @rickcrook @_JohnWhelan @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Why would I care what "the public" thought about the correctness of a transaction you, me and Chris had entered in to? The only thing we need from "somebody else" that we can't provide for ourselves is a neutral opinion on ordering., @jwolpert @AndrewDARMACAP @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @rickcrook @CollinCusce @Cordablockchain @JerryCuomo … 3) given all that, I’m not understanding why it’s being recommended for a set of use-cases that it wasn’t designed for. So I’m not saying “ya-boo… platform X sucks!” I’m saying “hang on… platform X was never designed for that…!”, @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Last time I checked, those guys running the massive mining farms were human beings, not ‘algorithms’, @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Hope they feel better soon!  And no rush., @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Ok - so this is interesting. But is there a valid set of assumptions under which this could work? (ie Paxos/BFT Byzantine ratio holds BUT we don’t have a bunch of bad guys trying to drive the consensus pool way higher than 100 nodes?), @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain My point is we KNOW bad things can happen to good people. The question is can they do anything about it or do they just have to suck it up if a tx gets reversed? The permissionless argument seems to be ‘if it happens to you, suck it up but don’t worry because “low probability”’/1, @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain You then present a conflicting tx. There *must* be at least one of those notary members that has signed both. So we know _precisely_ who is at fault. What’s the equivalent story for a PoW chain? It’s hard to construct an answer that doesn’t end with “sucks to be you”, right?, @jwolpert @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Ultimately, those who say “I’d rather know who’s providing my consensus and who to sue if they screw it up” aren’t (all!) unenlightened luddites… The risk of having a tx reversed unexpectedly and not even knowing if anybody was to blame is a scary thing for many use-cases. /4, @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain If you’ve answered, I’ve missed it (sorry if so). Are you saying “permissionlessness implies probabilistic finality” is incorrect, or that it’s correct but irrelevant? Something else?, @_JohnWhelan @jwolpert @rickcrook @asangoio @CollinCusce @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Sure. Consortia are hard. But I can think of a ton of ways using public Ethereum would have made LenderComm, https://t.co/DAXsYZQX7I or VAKT (to pick a Corda, Fabric and Quorum example) way harder and precious few that would have made them easier. What am I missing?, @CollinCusce @jwolpert @asangoio @AndrewDARMACAP @Cordablockchain Hi Collin - thanks for the comment! Ava is of course an elephant in this room :) And part of this discussion is to help me understand as I freely admit I am not a consensus PhD., @jwolpert @AndrewDARMACAP @asangoio @danoprey @_JohnWhelan @rickcrook @CollinCusce @Cordablockchain @JerryCuomo I’m not sure that’s _entirely_ fair :) My argument all along has been 1) how amazing Bitcoin’s consensus design was (and by extension Ethereum’s), 2) here’s what permissionless consensus is for/why it works/what problems it solves, but…]</td>

We also co-opt a small number of members for specific skills (e.g. We have co-opted a former football administrator &amp;amp; a webmaster recently), @Adam84501837 @su4eranio @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL I can't see the post that was responded to - it was blocked in your screenshot.. Maybe I am oblivious? I have obviously seen criticism e.g. For attending NDA mtg - we would have been criticised either way, and it allowed us to report back most of content to all fans., @dcfccollection @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL @WeAreTheFSA Tottenham also introducing fan rep on Board, @Adam84501837 @su4eranio @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL We - and me personally - received abuse in the past, both initially for criticising the 3 amigos, and then for the Trust not being aggressive enough. I still believe we did what we could and had to do, but can understand some have other views., @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL Would need to be discussed and agreed - and worth looking at how it is working at other clubs. Club cannot 'pick' as that defeats point of an elected representative., @dcfccollection @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL This already works successfully at a number of clubs in this country, including the Premiership. If you look on the @WeAreTheFSA  website there is a lot of information on how to make it work successfully., @Adam84501837 @su4eranio @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL We are absolutely not a closed group - anyone can join and contribute, please do.

I think a fan rep should be in all Board meetings and contribute to all discussions - obviously some more than others where fans affected. Rep needs to understand and represent supporters., @su4eranio @JWPerkinsUK @Inquis_chap @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL There is a strong argument to have both., @su4eranio @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL Disagree - if Board cannot discuss openly because it may be reported, then decisions will be made outside the mtg and board mtg would be irrelevant. Alternative is a mtg where decisions are just reported to rep once made., @Scoots_n_Boots @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL It wouldn't be a token random fan, it would need to be an individual with relevant skills who would need to sign board membership policy (including NDA) and agree what could be shared outside the meetings.

Until this season, he always insisted he was covering losses. It was clearly unsustainable without owner funding - as it is at many clubs (especially in the Championship)., @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL @redfern_i_j That is simply not true. We questioned Mel Morris and club officials throughout their time. We had no power to see the true situation or affect policy during that time. We still believe a supporters representative on the board could have made a difference., @dcfccollection @redfern_i_j @JakeBarker1212 @RamsTrust @EFL @VAVEL_EFL @VAVEL @WeAreTheFSA Brentford, Chelsea, Liverpool,..

That’s not fair to Donny, @Pyroshoxx @Hossholliday @FiremanDave29 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Yeah you’re right. We’ve only supporting the WoO since 2001., @jpracing11 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Very true., If you’re around Daytona come watch us race at Volusia Speedway racing with the @ASCoC tonight and tomorrow. We’ll be at @BubbaRaceway Friday and Saturday. We’re not allowed to bring our tshirt trailer for you fans to @WorldofOutlaws races so we won’t race with them this year, @28bk12 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Yes. They actually don’t have trailers but yes they would be too, @frayodom @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws The owner actually is trying to look out for their full time drivers. They feel that if anyone else brings a trailer that they will lose sales. It’s just their “opinion” thou. No facts to back it up, @Hossholliday @FiremanDave29 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws I thought I was a full time guy. I guess I’ve been spending a shit load of money in this series for no reason, @MidAmericanRace @RichFarmer29 @JoshHanson18 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Yeah you’re totally right. And some tracks pay out really big purses to those teams too, @Ryan_Stefani @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws At some point you have to take a stand. There’s much more to the story that I can’t write. If you knew the rest you’d understand, @1e4der @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Yes, exactly, @JamesNI34079777 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws It’s no different than the WoO series trailer selling last night at our AllStars Race, @dirtrackderrick @billysangel56 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws And being a “superstar “ has nothing to do with this. There’s much more to this that if it was told would make the Outlaws series look really bad. That’s not my intention. But I am going to take a stand. I’ve went above and beyond to help the series since 2001. I’ve done my part!, @dirtrackderrick @billysangel56 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws We charge ANY vendor at Eldora. That’s not new either. At WoO races they do not get charged. That’s part of the deal when you have a WoO event. Know your facts first, @mikeeggy @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws @KyleLarsonRacin You would think so., @GoSmoke2 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Just me. Schatz will be there, @DIKDRAGON @manofsteele123 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws You’re exactly right, @SquirrelyEvans @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws The Knoxville Nationals are not a WoO event. They’ve been trying to take it over for years thou, @Hossholliday @RichFarmer29 @JoshHanson18 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Yeah, look how much money we pay out too. More than most tracks. Great point 👍🏼, @SprintCarcast @MidAmericanRace @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws @EldoraSpeedway What about the people who own the teams that get shit on all the time plus all the stuff behind the scenes that none of you know about.   Should they support the owners that spend the money?!, @t_harshfield @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws @EldoraSpeedway Are you also confused on how much money Eldora pays out too?, @BLK67 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws For all I do and spend to support the Outlaws not to mention the things behind the scenes you don’t know that happen, you’d think they’d be more appreciative. We have other tracks we can run that WILL let us bring our trailer and sell merchandise to our fans. We’ll just go there, @billjwhite2 @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws This Friday and Saturday I’ll be at Bubba’s, @Hippyleslie @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws I am racing in Ocala Friday and Saturday nights. It’s only 70 miles from DIS, @ErocWolverine @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws Because we aren’t a full time  “driver” with the series and Brian Carter and a couple of the drivers (Darren Pittman) say I would be taking money out of their pockets by bringing my trailer., @CousinCarl99fan @ASCoC @BubbaRaceway @WorldofOutlaws They change rules all the time. Some people are just so greedy and shortsighted that they can’t see the big picture. But they will very soon😜]</td>

But it also raises concerns about exploiting people who are already at high risk (rather than addressing their risk circumstances)., @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner https://t.co/UjJbWhP0W3, @SteveJoffe @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner @ScottHalpernMD @JAMAInternalMed These participants should absolutely be reimbursed and compensated, and as @thedanahoward notes below, this amount actually isn't very much as an hourly rate. Incentive payments probably aren't needed, given the number of people who have indicated interest through @1daysooner., @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner @SeemaKShah @anetrid Plus guidance specific to SARS-CoV-2 challenge: https://t.co/pCBY9fYTYF, @DanielleWenner @neva9257 @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer Yes, I do think it's relevant where the study is being conducted (i.e., not US) and how easily care can be accessed + what promises will be made by the study to facilitate/provide long term care/compensation., @Josh41169057 @mlipsitch @GovindPersad @AlexJohnLondon @jasonkarlawish @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner There will almost certainly not be challenge studies done in children. If the studies proceed to challenge vaccinated individuals, which sounds like the next planned step, they will be able to see which vaccinated individuals become infected, how much virus they shed, etc., @AlexJohnLondon @GovindPersad @jasonkarlawish @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner I'm assuming these questions will be the topic of discussion at this upcoming event (2/22) w/ Meta Roestenberg (challenge researcher, planning SARS-CoV-2 challenge at Leiden U), Matt Memoli (challenge researcher at NIH), and @SeemaKShah (challenge ethics expert extraordinaire)., @AlexJohnLondon @GovindPersad @jasonkarlawish @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner You need to have a challenge model in place to do those subsequent studies (and it would have been ideal to have that model in place much earlier). But I haven't heard enough to be convinced of the social value for these particular studies that the UK has planned now., @AlexJohnLondon @GovindPersad @jasonkarlawish @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner Yes, answering open scientific questions won't help on the manufacture, distribution, hesitancy issues. I think challenge studies could have value at this point in trying to rapidly study vaccine efficacy against new variants + studying dose/scheduling issues relevant to supply., @SteveJoffe @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner @ScottHalpernMD @JAMAInternalMed @thedanahoward @1daysooner But if there is confidence that these studies are ethical to proceed, we shouldn't be very worried about inducing people to participate. We should, however, be concerned with making sure people understand what they're getting themselves into., @DanielleWenner @neva9257 @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer If the concern is that risks are too high in relation to claimed benefits, no amount of payment can help with that, nor does it help to take payment off the table (as you noted, @neva9257). If the concern is that payment would blind people to risks, that could be addressed., @SteveJoffe @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner @ScottHalpernMD @JAMAInternalMed @thedanahoward @1daysooner And if we're worried there will be inequitable distribution of burden/risk (because the privileged have other ways of making $6200), that can be attended to in participant selection - and by offering even more $ to attract the privileged, leveling everyone up to higher amounts., @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @AlexJohnLondon @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner @SeemaKShah @anetrid And more from a WHO working group: https://t.co/mGkH91BRFC, @GovindPersad @AlexJohnLondon @jasonkarlawish @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner Nir Eyal continues to write a lot about this, here's the most recent piece of his that I'm aware of: https://t.co/AaxPc13ewq, @AlexJohnLondon @jasonkarlawish @GovindPersad @SteveJoffe @emily_a_largent @_APeterson_ @domsisti @neva9257 @charlesweijer @DanielleWenner Personally I think we *could* ask 18-30 yo participants in regular trials to remain, if we had good enough reason to do so. And as you note in later comments, that good enough reason is exactly the concern with these challenge studies (some have other concerns, but that's mine).]</td>

I also write about history &amp;amp; music. It isn’t an “industry” book or a political book. It took 7 years to write. I spent a lot more time writing it than I did working that job. That said, working in the field was a defining period in my life., @NGLFundamentals @WillRayValentin @Albertagarbage @nimblephatty @QuickDCapital @FracSlap @Tejanobrown Yeah, it’s a good movie.

Spent 7 years writing &amp;amp; researching a book. While writing, worked as a stagehand, junk hauler, furniture mover etc. I accepted invite because I think Congress needs to hear from more working people &amp;amp; less “experts”, @HockeyTimeAB @Albertagarbage @nimblephatty @WillRayValentin @QuickDCapital @FracSlap @Tejanobrown I don’t act like anything. I make it clear in my book &amp;amp; in the article how long I worked. I worked in the patch for 10 months. Still have a lot of friends out there, @HockeyTimeAB @nimblephatty @Albertagarbage @WillRayValentin @QuickDCapital @FracSlap @Tejanobrown I’m not sure that I portray myself as a hardened hand. I’m clear exactly about how long I was there. It kicked my ass. I loved it. The guys I worked with would tell you I made a hand.

I was there for 10 months. I only hid in the truck for the first 2. The book is also a lot about my family and other parts of my life.

That's one of the "big lies"., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg We're already been down this road. Can you point to a single Middle East nation where non-Muslims lived - ever - as equals with Muslims?  \n\nHistory shows the opposite of this.  And you imagine a Jewish *minority* in what is now Israel?  C'mon man, who is the delusional one here., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw OK, you at least answered that one.  \n\nSo your solution is to make Jews a minority with a group of Muslims who view Jews as inferior "colonizers".  So you want a civil war, like in Yugoslavia or Lebanon, but worse.  Got it., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Israel is "the region"?, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw I know what the Sykes-Picot agreement is.  It's irrelevant to the main point I made., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Just like Saharans are the inhabitants of the Sahara region, or Levantines of the Levant, or Alpines from the Alps?, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw You can't get "polls from anywhere", LOL\n\nIf you can't acknowledge the problem, you'll never get to the solution., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw "yes jews lived in the ME until the zionist colonization."\n\nAGAIN, only as second class tolerated dhimmi.  Never as equals, and always as inferior., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Wrong.\n\nBut irrelevant.\n\nI know more than one professor who never set foot in ancient Greece, or 18th century America, who know a lot about the history of both both. \n\nNice try, though., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw A colony for what country?, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw You fail to understand that the Israel/Jew obsession is DUE to Islam's views of Jews.\n\nTell me friend, why does a *tiny* nation occupy so much mental space to people in place like Indonesia, Somalia, Pakistan, etc.?  \n\nIt's because of Islam's OBSESSION with Jews. https://t.co/VEZT1sPTbq, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw I'm an atheist.  We come from the same origins.  Islam is the worst curse on the region.  It prevents peace because it divided people.  I don't like the crazy Jews either., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Now you claim ISIS was a creation of the West.  Sad, mate, really sad. \nYou have such a distorted view of reality.\nBut it's wonderful that others who read this thread will see how people like you think. \nhttps://t.co/K28Uf6q5QR, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw No, I see you as brothers. Really.  Most Palestinian Arabs descend in part from forcibly converted Jews.  Really sad., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg LOL - Chomsky is the most overrated intellectual on the planet. I wasn't impressed., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg It's about Islamism and the views of Jews.  It's about Islamic superiority, a view held by too many Muslims.  You can't admit this is the core of the problem.  You deny basic facts - so there is not point in conversing.  Thank you.\nhttps://t.co/XwNA22EmHs, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg the phrase, "compared to", is key, isn't it.  Sir Martin Gilbert, official biographer of Winston Churchill said it best.  "So when there was a lull in persecution - bless them - they called it 'the golden age'. https://t.co/SHzf8Bro5W, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Nice try, mate. There is an OBSESSION with Israel and Jews, and when I ask Muslims why this is, the ones I respect will admit that Muslims are obsessed with Jews.  \n\nThen there are the ones like you, who think pointing out the obsession and hypocrisy are "changing the topic".  😅 https://t.co/xuK7puIU5x, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Actually, I support compromise, and a three state solution.  Jordan is already part of the Palestine Mandate, with a majority population of Palestinian Arabs.  A confederation of Jordan with parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and Israel., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg I propose a separation between Palestinian Arabs and Israelis into separate nations.\n\nYou propose the elimination of Israel into one bi-national entity where Jews are a minority under Islam.  \n\nYes, I think it's relevant to understand what the ramifications of this would be., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Embarrassing for you, maybe.  For me, I present facts and back them up.  :), @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Have you looked at any maps?  For example, of Turkey?  The entire Muslim nation is built on stolen Greek and Armenia lands. https://t.co/Y3pJQu2wIS, @ChronicBabak @RachelJessWolff The article has the actual document, translated from Arabic. Argue on facts, not who presents the facts.\n\nFor example, even if this wasn't Yale (it is), we can clearly see the genocidal threat from Hamas.  They cite a prophesy (hadith) about killing Jews. https://t.co/zYxZev3CMu, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Hizbullah, the Shia Islamic "Army of God" is the defacto ruler of Lebanon after a sectarian civil war.

Not accurate, but it must feel good., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw BTW, you never acknowledged you were wrong when you said, "Israel is by far responsible for most civilian deaths in the region".  I showed you proof that you were wrong.  Why be stubborn about it?  🙂, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Hamas makes no bones about their obsession with Jews and that it's a religious conflict. Millions of Muslims agree.

Look at all the factions who will tell you so, right in those regions., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Every tweet like this is proof of how brainwashed the Israel haters are.  I hope a lot of normal Americans see these tweets, so they understand who el-Kurd represents. \n\nAND... if you want to talk about stealing land, start with the Muslim conquests. More recently, Armenia. https://t.co/7Ri9d9EuC6, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Well friend, I guess we have concluded our exchange of views. \n\nI thought that you could at least acknowledge that Islam's view of Jews as dhimmi أهل الذمة is what perpetuates the conflict. \n\nCompromise would be possible, but not with those who seek to destroy you. Thank you., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw If you are a Palestinian Arab, I get it why it's important to you. But do you ever ask why others care? The only reason is bc of Islamic supremacy. It's purely tribal. Muslims are obsessed with Jews.  \n\nIf you can't acknowledge this, all other discussions are pointless., @RachelJessWolff The only good that comes from this is that the obfuscation about SJP goals is being removed; the "shroud of the dark side" is coming off. Maybe some Jews will start realizing that the goals from 1947 is still the goal today.  In their own words: https://t.co/l4bODtuxdg, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Ottomans had different boundaries.  Europe.  Asia.  You don't know your world history. https://t.co/360ZilSmmU, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Just please acknowledge the problem with Islam's views on Jews.

I'm curious.  Thank you., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw So tell me friend, what do YOU think is the solution?  We'll get back to how this whole thread started.  el-Kurd thinks the solution is all the Jews go, and to where he could care less.  Just leave or be killed.  Do you agree with him?  If you do, say so and we can part ways., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg I thought we agreed to part ways my friend?  You must enjoy seeing me clarify each misstatement you make?, @RachelJessWolff No need for security because Jews are not Jihadis.  Imagine if there was a Jewish speaker who called for genocide against Palestinian Arabs as the "solution" for the I/P conflict., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Now you're defending a tax that non-Muslims were forced to pay with "submission". Got it.\n\nYeah, I'm sure their would be loving kindness shown from a Muslim-majority population towards the despised Jews. 🤣\nhttps://t.co/8hMslSFH5l, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw No, and no.  Palestine refers to a region much larger than modern Israel. You forget the entire EAST bank of the Jordan. https://t.co/s4AYreAOda, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw "Israel is by far responsible for most civilian deaths in the region."\n\nFactually wrong.  Not even close.  Not even remotely close. https://t.co/LJeBYuw8H1, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg No one would/should be stateless.  That is on the surrounding Umma of Muslim nations that have kept Palestinian Arabs as pawns in the goal to eliminate the only Jewish nation in the world.  Blame them. https://t.co/zu3IDqGyHi, @ChronicBabak @RachelJessWolff I'm not Israeli, and the quote is not propaganda. I can understand why you would like it to be, because it's embarrassing. Truth prevails.  \nhttps://t.co/3Bmy62eiEF, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Nice try.  You said the West created ISIS, not that the West backed different factions. A bit of a switch, no?, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw You don't appear to know much about world history.  After WWII, millions upon millions were refugees all over the globe.  Boundaries were redrawn.  You might prefer Jews are homeless, but that's not how it works., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg ISIS debated this for "infidels".  It's come up in the 20th century.  It's part of the Islamic Supremacist world view. https://t.co/hIAYEge98F, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg https://t.co/XyWShcgj86, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg You use terms so loosely.  "zionists... atrocities".  \n\nNo atrocities, unlike Hamas, and just about every Islamist group and Islamic majority nation within a 1000 miles of Israel.\n\nSo do you oppose all the Islamic nations? "ethnic and religious supremacist (nations)", @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw When tens of millions of Muslims believe suicide terrorist attacks against civilians are "justified", that's a big problem.  Let's not pretend that a survey of other religions would find the same views.  They have the surveys, and they don't., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw For every radical Jew, I can show 100 radical Muslims. That's a key distinction.  Radical Muslims and their ideology is embraced by mainstream Muslims, whereas radical Jews are shunned., @hagar_and @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @StopAntisemites Context matters. If Palestinian Arabs today speak about a "right of return", but Jewish refugees aren't even mentioned, that creates a false narrative. India and Pakistan, also late 1940s, swapped Muslim w/Hindus. If that was OK, so was the Jewish w/Muslims swap. https://t.co/Yf7fBEOWDs, @ChronicBabak @ani_bencohen @Andrewshka1776 @fluffyrocket27 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Jews as a group were there prior to Islam.  But you are correct, that DNA shows that many Palestinian Arabs have Jewish ancestry.  Islam forcible converted many, many people.  It also has a doctrine to keep them Muslim, whether they want to be or not. Great religion. https://t.co/1X39oHwRG0, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg For an atheist, you sure have a soft spot for Islam. https://t.co/87dgedPf0N, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg The descendants of Judea are not colonizers.  This is why we cannot proceed further in dialogue. You can't accept two important facts.\n1. Islam's role in perpetuating the conflict\n2. Jews are not colonizers; they are returning to their homeland, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg You want "justice" only for Arabs in the small part of the Levant that you call Palestine.  You could *care less* what happens to Jews.  That is a recipe for continual conflict. So I have nothing further to say to you., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Oh sure, Jews were colony of no country in particular, just "the west".  Really.  Tell me more., @SaeenDiddyCombs @Mevalemadre201 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Can't take the truth either. \nhttps://t.co/jrV0bJPaA4, @SaeenDiddyCombs @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw You won't turn the USA into most Muslim majority nations.  Not my opinion; look at the PEW survey results. \n\nExample A.  Tens of millions of Muslims believe that apostates should be killed.  \n\nNo wonder you hate Jews so much and want them to be in danger. https://t.co/WqbPOwafh1, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Friend, you just don't know your history.\n\nYour way of thinking will mean a war that never ends.  I guess that why it never does, and every year Israel grows stronger.  I prefer peace, but not at any cost., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg "Some of Islam's jurists mandated a number of other humiliating rituals at the time of jizya payment, including that the presiding Muslim official slap, choke, and in some cases pull the beard of the paying dhimmi, who might even be required to approach the official on all fours", @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg "The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers.... But the religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.", @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw I agree that the main victims are other Muslims.  That is a fact. But *way* too many Muslims sympathize with abhorrent views. https://t.co/lTBnr6NWHl, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Oh really?  Friend, I'm too educated on this topic for your usual propaganda to be effective.  I know the truth. https://t.co/ufTjAiOtQU, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw "our lived experience is worth more than all the sources u claim to read.."\n\nSpoken like a true intellectual.  😂, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg "live normal"\n\nName one.  Name a country in the Middle East where non-Muslims live AS FULL EQUALS.  Go ahead.  I'll wait.🙂, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw I'm a big of fellow atheist @SamHarrisOrg too.  Enjoy the read, and why an atheist should look at all the details on Israel before judging. \nhttps://t.co/Vmbjc5THeO, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw As to truth, even the Israel-obsessed, no-friend-of-Jews Mehdi Hasan wrote about it.  A rare moment of honesty.  Read it and try to tell me you don't understand what he's talking about. \nhttps://t.co/ff4koQt1eR, @hagar_and @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @StopAntisemites And hearing radical Islamists lecture me on occupation and expulsion elicits the same reaction in me. https://t.co/WynJdEPt7J, @SaeenDiddyCombs @Mevalemadre201 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw "can't take a joke", 😂\n\nhttps://t.co/ritr4z4dD0, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw That's the story you've been told.  I get it.  If I were brainwashed my entire life, I'd probably have a hard time knowing what is true and what is a lie.  I understand that it's hard to see truth when you are immersed in lies.  You did it once (atheist, like me).  Try again., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg Again - once more - if the goal is to eliminate Israel, and expel the Jewish population, I don't think peace is possible. Only when Muslims accept that Jews are returning to their homeland and are an (notice "an", not "the") indigenous population to the land will there be peace., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Religion IS the root cause, mate. Islam and Islamic supremacy, and the terrible views on Jews.  I've told you that about 10 times. \nGood luck, and take care. https://t.co/pAmvPS5hEp, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Man, you just can't accept the facts.  And they *are* facts.  You can't even admit that Jews and other non-Muslims weren't treated as equals?  That's a very basic fact to admit.  I've read entire history books about the regions and no one denies this... but you do., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Now do the graph for Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Allies from WWII.\n\nMore deaths does not equal more morality. \n\nLots of jihadis died in Iraq too., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Ah, the appeal of such simple dichotomies... it's like still believing in fairy tales, the Easter bunny.  Comforting, but lies., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw "Jews lived in the ME for a long time before the zionist entity was established in Palestine."\n\nYeah, just like Blacks lived in the USA under Jim Crow. You sound like the Southerns on that one.  "We ain't never had any Negros complain until you Northern folks showed up"., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Here's the original, if you want to hear it in Arabic. \nhttps://t.co/sPq16OSDaQ, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Man, you just can'/won't see the truth here.  It must create such cognitive dissonance for you, that every defense mechanism gets employed to defend the indefensible., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg You're kidding, right?  Do I need to point out the details on this, or just tell me you're joking.  You did read the "full equals" part, right?, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw @SamHarrisOrg btw, here's your international politics "genius" Chomsky saying Trump has the best take on Ukriaine 😅\nhttps://t.co/eLu4KxAIer, @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw Friend, I've got to take care of real life - but I'll reply later.

May you grow and learn more, and see more shades of gray than the simplistic black and white you currently see.  May you be exposed to history from non-biased sources, and may you grow from all that you learn., @Ali47888545 @RachelJessWolff @GeorgetownLaw You don't see Jews are deserving a nation.  I do.

      <td>[@FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Have you got a link to said statement?? Your inability to provide ANY backup is soooo annoying. \n\nProvince still reporting and making policy off of misrepresented "hospitalizations". Doug's own spokesperson said so. Nothing has been done to improve provincial reporting., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth So hard to make out what you're saying with Doug Ford's cock so far down your throat, Fred. Can you spit it out for 5 mins and try again. Bring stats and data. Still waiting., @Max_Power_ @Christinedaley_ @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth We should also make them foot the bill for their care. \n\nYour body, your choice, your bill., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth That's not how the province has been reporting "hospitalizations"... If you go to the hospital with a GSW and are covid+, you're counted as covid hospitalization. That's totally misleading and not the way policies should be written as it's a misinterpretation of the data., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Facts:\n✅Cases≠hospitalizations\n✅Omicron super mild\n✅Hospitalizations misrepresented by gov\n✅ICU admissions declining\n✅ Unvaxxed 67% of ICU patients\n✅Gov and media misrepresenting facts\n✅Fred easily fooled by government's misrepresented facts., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth 14 years' experience with data analysis + a degree in political science. Not a doctor, but it's pretty easy to see that your beloved government is falsifying the "hospitalization" rate and using this information to set policy. Which is right in my field of expertise, actually., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Like... You even responded to it. \n\nSelective reading strikes ole Freddy again., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Unnecessary lockdowns, panic and fear mongering are decidedly *not* good for the public good. \n\nPublic good means prioritizing the masses over the single digit ICU admissions and forcing the unvaccinated to pay out of pocket for their (completely preventable) care., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont How about I just call you out for being...  a what? https://t.co/DIU24U4wTv, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont As for places imposing rules. It just takes one region to cave to public panic for all other jurisdictions in the dominoes to say "well Canada locked down... We should too." Even though the lockdowns were based on faulty data. \n\nTLDR: public panic. 8/8, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Lmao. Not what I'm saying at all. Bye Fred. Enjoy your ignorance., @kevindmcmahon @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth They count as a Covid hospitalization, per the way the province counts. \n\nSame for stabbings and gunshot wounds. Arguably those people are *not* hospitalized because of Covid.... Making the reporting of these numbers suspect. Forming policy based on them is lunacy., @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth And a friendly reminder that "hospitalization" doesn't necessarily mean "hospitalized because of covid" - just in the hospital with covid. Big difference that few seem to grasp as the media tends to ignore it ... \n\nNot sensational enough?, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Fancy! Too bad you have zero clue how to actually read data. \n\nBut congrats on your fancy expensive pieces of paper., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth At the end of the day: we *all* want to be out of this as safely as possible - but I contend that we need to look at a much broader picture of safety &amp;amp; public health. Pandemic pandemonium is destroying us more than the virus is. A *measured* response is required 2 years in., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth You're literally the densest person I've had the displeasure of interacting with on Twitter. And that's saying a lot. \n\nGo enjoy your lockdown you complete and total wanker., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont "rising sharply" \n\nFewer ICU admissions than December, Wankity McWankwank https://t.co/YFYCZa8DNh, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Bruh. I responded to this already. Here's the tweet: \n\nhttps://t.co/SAobYRPxeM, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Here's the link again for you https://t.co/SAobYRPxeM, @FredFred1406 https://t.co/8IepfBdAjU, @FredFred1406 https://t.co/eSQgJjUcwV, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Because I know how to read data and our elected officials and media do not. \n\nBut they won an election so definitely blindly follow them. They've only had two years to prove their competence.........., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Yes. Complete and total fabrication. LIESSSS. You're being lied to. \n\nI get it, you *want* to trust your elected officials. But unfortunately, liars gonna lie. It's important to call them out for it VS just blindly believing and following. \n\nGood luck with that. 👍, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Winning an election in 10 months, derp derp. That's what's in it for them. \n\nYour inability to grasp the way politics works is super duper not my problem., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth - UK not imposing restrictions. \n- Denmark didn't see a rise in hospitalizations or ICU admissions \n- Omicron barely a blip in South Africa. \n\nCases ≠ hospitalizations and ICU admissions - especially amongst the vaccinated. \n\nSo yes, they're inciting panic too. We agree!, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth And then we learn (via @patrickbrownont) that "hospitalizations" doesn't actually mean people are hospitalized *WITH* covid and it calls the entire operation into question. \n\nIf things are "so bad" that we need to shut down, shouldn't we base those numbers off of *facts*? 5/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth You're so so so short sighted, Freddy. Good luck. Donate some money to a local charity when I turn out to be completely correct. \n\nStill waiting for you to send some stats or evidence my way that backs up your Doug Ford deep throating., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Then help me understand Fred. You have yet to do it. A handful of petty insults, the word "ilk" twice and a mysterious love affair with Doug Ford... Yet... Nothing that actually backs up your argument other than, "they're trying their best. Why would they lie?", @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont If you say 50 people are hospitalized*because* of covid and that's up XX% over yesterday, we need to take action - that's one thing. But when the data set is flawed, what do you do? Look at ICU admissions - which are flat. 6/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth People freaked out. Were scared. Terrified. Science table kept issuing more fear and panic. "could" "maybe" "death" - and yeah, pre-vaxx, things were bad. Especially for old, high BMI, preexisting conditioned folks who, sadly, died. \n\n3/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Projecting, much? Jesus Christ. You're chosing to ignore the deluge of evidence in favor of your own fantasies. \n\n"The provincial guy" is the premier's spokesperson. The other person who said it was Brampton's mayor and former PC leader @patrickbrownont., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Thirty two. In a city of more than a million people? \n\nDefinitely worth shutting the province down for. 👍, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Fred - here is a much more eloquent way of what I was saying about Doug just doing this for "we did everything we could" election talking points. https://t.co/TW7k75BHw8, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Then don't. Enjoy the panic. 👍\n\nLooking forward to that $5 when the AG report drops in 5 years. \n\nPeace out, Freddy., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Also here's a reason to show that they are, in fact, acting in bad faith by misrepresenting hospitalization numbers. Via @TorontoStar / Brampton Guardian: https://t.co/Nhiz4xPKgX, @FredFred1406 https://t.co/EMAkee6lmf, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth What do Ottawa's numbers say? 3 new icu admissions? We're shutting down our province for this? We're ruining our children's mental health for this? We're destroying our economy for this? \n\nIt's just not worth it. It really isn't., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth That's the thing about bases, they'll vote for you anyway. There's not much you need to do to keep them happy. \n\nAnd I have no doubt he'll throw some sort of red meat at them the week before election day., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont I have gifs too! https://t.co/vi3mVGhfOI, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Yes I am. She lied. You've been lied to. This is why I'm so pissed, Fred. We're being LIED to. \n\nAlso,the data caption in that CBC article reinforces what I said. "Ottawans with COVID-19 in an Ottawa hospital" ≠ hospitalized b/c of Covid.\n\nFrom TorStar: \nhttps://t.co/Nhiz4xPKgX, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Literally begging you for some real data, Fred. You have nothing but blind faith in the government and the science table. \n\nI'd wait for the data but it'll never appear because it doesn't exist., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth And so you blindly accept that he's looking out for the collective good of Ontario and not say... Covering his ass to look like he's done something when staring down the barrel of an election? \n\nI, unfortunately, don't have the same blind faith in our elected officials., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Still no data 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Fortunately I've done both. So all bases are covered., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth To clarify: not *all* reported hospitalizations are because of Covid. If you're in the hospital because you got stabbed AND you're covid+, that counts as a Covid hospitalization. \n\nAgree that our HC system is underfunded and understaffed. Another reason I hate anti-vaxx idiots., @FredFred1406 I answered your questions you dense twat. Enjoy your lockdown, wanker. https://t.co/uY61547gxS, @FredFred1406 https://t.co/50rmZyGQuY, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont And it matters because the numbers are what are dictating the policy. So when there are ANOMALIES in the numbers, question the policy. Which I've done repeatedly. \n\nIdk how we keep going in circles but it might be because you're a dense wanker, you dense wanker. https://t.co/9wJOZYoPVv, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Panic: Pandemic 'hit' in March 2020 when the Zeitgeist was dialled up to an 11 in terms of divisiveness, misinformation, fake news, etc. Pandemic was like a grenade in a napalm factory. Panic ensues. \n\nWhat'd people panic buy? Toilet paper. Basic Freudian anal retention 2/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Enjoy your panic then! Don't forget to wipe all your groceries down even though we've known the virus doesn't live on surfaces since April 2020. 🤪 https://t.co/79e6E9cSYL, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth No conspiracies. Take your gaslighting elsewhere. \n\nFor someone with 100 degrees, you sure have no clue how to present an argument and prove it. Instead, ad hominem attacks. Classy!, @JustmeSmileyfa1 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth No I'm not not not. Read the article. \n\nThe data table clearly says "Ottawans with COVID-19 in an Ottawa hospital" - which is *massively* different than "hospitalized because of covid". \n\nStabbed &amp;amp; covid+? You're a covid case by this measure. Which is a poor way to make policy., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth They've also shown they're completely incapable of doing the one thing they're supposed to do: govern and legistlate. \n\nShutdowns = lazy legislation. Especially when the data shows they're completely unnecessary., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Here's the premier's spokesperson admitting as much: 💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅 https://t.co/2XEqCNwRR4, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Simple: public panic. \n\nI don't think the science table is intentionally misleading people. They're reporting raw numbers. I suggest they're only looking at data from a 90% UNvaccinated population. If we were still 90% unvaxxed, the panic would be justified. 1/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Also, it's *clear* from existing data in Ontario that the vaccine is quite good at keeping the vast majority of vaccinated people out of the ICU. \n\nIf our gov knew how to legislate, they'd dial up the pressure on the unvaccinated. (my suggestion: they pay for their covid care), @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth @patrickbrownont The point is that the government is trying to quell *public panic* by demonstrating some large scale public action based on false data and "could"-based projections from the science table (who will *always* give us the worst case scenario). \n\nIt's a cycle of ineptitude. 7/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Time goes on and now we're double vaxxed but we're still responding to the raw science table numbers, inciting panic in the populace. Even though there's literally no data or evidence (stilllll waiting!) to suggest that ICU admissions will rise with case load. \n\n4/, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Lmao. There's no data to suggest that a lockdown is necessary amongst an 80% vaccinated population. \n\nThere are "projections" based on an unvaccinated population. But nothing from any country Omicron has blown through to warrant this kind of panic and fear mongering., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth They're making "projections" based on full strength COVID and it's impact on an unvaccinated population. I assume they're in good faith - my issue is the gov and media run with "coulds" and impose lockdowns when correlated data (UK, Den, SA) suggest it's unnecessary., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth EXCEPT that the hospitalizations reported aren't *because* of COVID. Again, a major thorn in my side with this whole thing. \n\nHow many of those hospitalizations are actually in the hospital, taking up a bed? Because ICU admissions are flat. Especially compared to case level., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth The province is misrepresenting hospitalization data. Premier's spokesperson said so. Mayor of Brampton is on record saying so. Links provided again and again...\n\nCan't make it any clearer. Stop being so ignorant and thick., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth When the inevitable Auditor General report comes out in 5-10 years, betcha $5 it shows that lockdowns were unnecessary and did more harm than good. \n\nDomestic violence 🆙\nOpioid overdoses 🆙\nAlcohol sales 🆙\nCannabis sales 🆙\nICU admissions amongst the vaccinated ⬇️, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth And then focus on the (likely) demographic commonality of the vaccinated+ICU cases and focus efforts there. Just a guess: age, BMI, immunocompromised, preexisting conditions all factors. Target resources there. \n(Just what I'd do if I were "elected" King 😜), @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Well one cannot run for king, that's not how monarchies work... But sure. Keep these attacks coming. You've yet to show *any* data to prove me wrong. Just regurgitation of the same misleading data that I'm criticizing. \n\nIf you can prove me wrong, do it. I'm waiting., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth I don't think there's any major motive to deceive people (save for Ford trying to lay the groundwork of "action" for the upcoming election.)\n\nI think they're using incomparable data sets to make the projections. And I'm frustrated because comparable data is readily available., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Already sent that tweet to ya. Try and keep up., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth Well they're obviously going to spin it to read as "took decisive and urgent action" and the simple followers who have such blind faith in our government (FRED - that's you!!) will eat it up like candy., @FredFred1406 https://t.co/s2CasrR43i, @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth My arrogance is based on all publicly available data to date which shows that the panic over "cases" combined with the falsification of "hospitalization" data is unfounded and ludicrous to base policy decisions off of. \n\nReal info. Not Facebook Group garbage., @FredFred1406 @CBCOttawa @OttawaHealth And my ilk? We're Fact-based, pro-vaxx, anti-panic people seeking sensible solutions that don't involve (pointless) shutdowns? \n\nWe also understand that the media peddles fear for clicks and that the unvaccinated are costing us a fucking fortune. \n\nWe're a growing bunch!

They can only get vetted by EFL Fit &amp;amp; Proper Persons test AFTER that - meaning (like Alonso) he can spend a lot of time to find its pointless., @NigelOwen77 @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Many reasons for that, but certainly a factor., @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Agreed - arguments on both sides currently whether protests would be best for the club, was clearer then., @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Any buyer wants to know EFL decision first - are they buying club that can realistically stay in Championship this season?, @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial More complex than just checking credit rating - Alonso provided proof of funds, but failed EFL test., @Adam84501837 @NigelOwen77 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Level of investment and time required to get out of League 1 could double cost &amp;amp; time required before Premier - which would be aim of any buyer., @DomT77 @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial EFL has to be sorted first., @WayneT70 @Adam84501837 @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @teamluca @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Accepted, but it was a minority who objected., @Adam84501837 @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @WayneT70 @teamluca @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial How many supporters objected when Mel was pumping money into the club to try for promotion? It was only going to be sustainable with promotion, but majority of fans would never complain. We did ask where money was coming from, and it was not debt/loan (at the time)., @Adam84501837 @NigelOwen77 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Agree entirely, but difficult to sell that to fans. No owner can commit to putting unlimited funds in forever, but telling fans to object to anyone wanting to put money in is tricky., @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Same logic still applies though - what would protesting achieve? Morris wants to sell, and angry supporters could put off buyers., @Adam84501837 @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Nail hit on head - everyone is criticising Mel (with some justification), but you have to know the alternatives are better..., @NigelOwen77 @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Absolutely - he has made mistakes and admits it. However I do believe he has interests of club at heart - some owners don't., @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Obviously we are all worried - can you see a solution?, @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial BTW This highlights issue with the game. Premier clubs are mostly run unsustainably but EFL clubs are supposed to - which makes it impossible to compete (e.g. with parachute clubs). Was explained to govt in fan-led review. Need changes to the game., @Adam84501837 @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial We would investigate any potential owner, we looked into Alonso but there was little evidence of any real track record (or funding..)., @redfern_i_j @Adam84501837 @NigelOwen77 @WayneT70 @teamluca @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial I can see your point if view, but we would have been criticised either way.

We listened to Mel putting his side of the story - I'm sure there is another, but that is probably also covered by privacy agreements..., @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Yes, and I think he does, but getting more desperate the longer it takes., @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @NigelOwen77 @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial The EFL has rules designed to be for the good of the game &amp;amp; clubs, but have to be consistent (not approve accounts, then say they need resubmitting...), @NigelOwen77 @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Would love that to be the case, but there will always be a minority... Tbh wouldn't even be a minority if we start losing., @NigelOwen77 @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Administration, Liquidation, or an owner taking money out of the club not investing (e.g. SISU). There are many examples of worse owners., @Adam84501837 @NigelOwen77 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial I don't think so - but as I say, wasn't discussed (or wasn't answered when we asked). Could not discuss ongoing negotiations covered by NDA with buyers., @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial On EFL criteria, Mel would be a Fit &amp;amp; Proper person to take over any club now.

Getting contact from members on both sides - being discussed., @NigelOwen77 @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial The point of the letter was to get the club to respond.

Too late to think about that now..., @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial He would not go into detail, but I think he just wants debts taken on to cover value of ground. He more or less said that in Al Jazeera documentary - and didn't know he was being recorded., @NigelOwen77 @Adam84501837 @WayneT70 @teamluca @redfern_i_j @ConcernedSuppo1 @RamsTrust @dcfcofficial Pretty sure he would. EFL are looking for owners who can keep the club running and valid source of funds. They will ask for business plan, but can't know how any owner will behave in future. (see Wigan)]</td>

Russia only has 2 customers for its oil\nThe only impact the global price has on Russian oil is in setting a (discounted) price that India and China would be willing to pay -- until their storage is maxxed out., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Were you even AROUND 2 years ago? Oversupply of oil and oil storage capacity are positively WELDED to prices. And NO. They don't get higher.:  \nhttps://t.co/94R20No8p1, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent The haven't been "deployed"... they just bought themselves an airline ticket with their own money. They come from free countries -- their governments can't order them not to., @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Well... @VctorBu2 said, "Put a reminder on this conversation three months from now, and we'll see who was the one who didn't know", and he was the one didn't know. Surely, he's a man of his word., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent My motorcycle's packed up, and I'm off the water park with my girlfriend -- then Japanese for dinner. Later for the discussion of junior high school thermodynamics., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent They're a few hundred volunteers from around the world who are risking their lives to support Ukraine. They not active-duty personnel. On the other hand, Russia's trying to recruit thousands of active troops from North Korea. Are you cool with that?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Yeah... no. Ukraine welcome to ask, but they're not joining NATO anytime soon. NATO job is to keep the peace, and provoking Russia is not an effective strategy for accomplishing that., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent You have trouble making friends? How awful for you. Have you tried not being a dick?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Russia also tried to block Zelensky from addressing the UN Security Council on Ukrainian Independence Day. Russia failed because China refused to support its position. What kind of "alliance" is that?, @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Don't engage. I think he's about 14, emotionally. That can be a difficult age for some children., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent I never mentioned the Budapest agreement, and the only person at issue with reality appears to be you., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Ukraine didn't ask for this war. Russia invaded with tanks and weapons with the intent to destroy a democratically elected government, take over the country. What should Ukraine have done? Write a strongly-worded letter in protest?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent OMG... you're actually insane. Zelensky was voted into office by 70% of voters in Ukraine in a free and fair election. Ukraine was never under consideration for NATO -- and even if it were -- it would require all NATO members to support that decision., @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Yeah... What can you do?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Once China and India's storage capacity is maxxed, sales will fall of a cliff., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Yes. Victor. I say this with the greatest sincerity -- You do not know anything about Americans., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent ALL of them have happened. Russia's "pal" China? China's UnionPay's payment system was shut down in Russia. No notice. All charges now declined. Demand for UnionPay cards skyrocketed in Russia following Visa and MC’s exit due to the invasion. China just shut it all down. Boom!, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent The US is trying to REDUCE the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and placing any in Ukraine would simple raise international tensions without providing any practical benefits whatsoever. It's absurd on its face., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Russia weakened itself by its own choices. Putin's turned Russia into an international pariah; wreck its economy; strengthen and expand NATO; and accelerate Europe's transition to renewable energy. Actually, the last one is a good thing., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent That's nice. Good for them. California's economy is still larger than Russia's. Italy's too., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent The goal of US and Russian nuclear de-proliferation talks was reducing weapons on BOTH sides. Otherwise neither side would've sat down to talk. Doi., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent The Ukrainians needed only a weekend of training on the Harpoon anti-ship missiles before they sank the Moskva. They're smart, motivated, and perfectly capable of handing this conflict without any international troops on the ground.  \nhttps://t.co/ur4PMdTGIc, @aaroncw @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Agreed. Ukraine is effectively under NATO's wing, short of an actual Article 5 (collective defense) agreement -- and the whole world is watching. Moscow's whole house-of-cards may collapse in a few months anyway., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent What Russia did is simply "bad for business". Like any smart businessperson, China is very happy to sit back, allow Russia to continue to make mistakes, and then pick up some bargains when Russia finishes tanking its economy and infrastructure., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent "Rs rubble is getting stronger..." Russia is an economy in freefall. Putin's engaged in an unsustainable monetary intervention -- pumping out the last of Russia’s cash reserves to make things seem less desperate then the actually are. I give it two more months, at most., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent You're splitting hairs. What "international brigades"? Mexican banditos? Sicilian mafia? What are you even talking about?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Russia and India are regional, not global., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent When that happens, oil prices on the global market -- which had already been going down due to reduced demand from India and China -- will be depressed even further. When India and China buy their next round of gas and oil from Russia, it will be at an even GREATER discount., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent China isn't being "cautious". They just don't want to drawn into the disaster Russia created for itself. The US is China's biggest customer -- and by "customer", I mean relationships with tens of thousands of private US companies. It isn't the monolithic bloc of your fantasies., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent US Speaker of the House. I've seen her before., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent "Russia has been consolidating its alliance with China and India..." OMG... China has publicly committing to support Ukraine's territorial sovereignty — and has refused to aid the Russian military in any way., @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Remember what Zelenskyy said? Zelenskyy said he needed "ammo, not a ride". Exactly the right thing to say, and the US took him at his word., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Wagner Group's mercenaries are all over Ukraine -- they come from different countries too. I guess that makes them an "international brigade". But that's OK, right?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Are you claiming US forces have been deployed to Ukraine? Are you completely nuts?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent WRONG. The largest consumers of oil are either buying Russian oil at a 30% discount (China, India), or not buying it AT ALL. It can't realistically be averaged with normal market pricing. Once its buyers maximum storage capacity is reached, Russia will have no place to sell it., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Wagner's GREY ZONE admits neither the lend-lease program or "foreign mercenaries" played any part in the current Ukrainian counter-offensive. He says it's just Russia screwing up over the past 30 years.\nhttps://t.co/OEtHGzD6og https://t.co/ZiMq6brhO2, @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Agreed. I have to bound anyway. You a Jets fan? NYC?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Invade Crimea? Who? Victor. I don't where you're getting your information from, but I assure you, it's complete horseshit. Are you living in Europe, or somewhere else?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent I live in southeast Asia. Before that, Shanghai and Hong Kong. What makes you an expert on China? And what the hell is a pelossi?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent We're not talking about global oil prices. We're talking about what Russia can earn from its oil. The are two ENTIRELY different things., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent With what army? According to the Russian MoD, as of August 24, there were 48,759 Russians killed. The Finance Ministry estimates that the average number of deaths per month going forward is 8,132. Meaning, the number as of today, according to Russia, is 53,232 Russians dead. https://t.co/1Iw073tHFM, @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Recording this as he's fleeing to Russia. 😂, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent If man-on-man action excites you that much, you've got much bigger problems than I thought..., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent @VctorBu2 is ABSOLUTELY correct. Russia CAN'T halt oil production. If Russia stopped oil production during the Siberian winter it would permanently damage its production infrastructure. The oil gels -- wells would have to be re-drilled, and pipelines would have to be re-built. https://t.co/z102YUhDV2, @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent If you mean something besides running in circles while screaming like little girls, then yes. I don't think they've prepared much in terms of defense., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Russia will be ready for it. A lot of Russian troops are still wearing the winter uniforms they were issued back in February. BTW: What's the temperature in Kherson this week? 72-80°F (22-27°C)?, @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent But even Wagner says the amount of US and UK volunteers is too small to have any impact on what happening in Ukraine. It's Russia fault for screwing things up so badly., @vman29397 @VctorBu2 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Hi boys. Russia is already relocating officials from Kupainsk to Vovchansk to escape. Some expect Kupainsk to be liberated in 24-48 hours. Looks like you were dead wrong @VctorBu2. You owe @vman29397 an apology., @VctorBu2 @vman29397 @LetsTakeWalk @KyivIndependent Whatever cherry-picked, isolated, irrelevant nonsense makes you happy. It doesn't move the needle on the bigger picture. China's buying Russia's gas and oil because A.) They're getting it 30% below the spot price, and B.) Russia only has two customers anyway.]</td>

You're pretty quick to move on &amp;amp; change subject of argument when it suits you. \n\nI showed you evidence of how people are more likely to want to participate in science when they see/hear their people/voices., @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology (So I can dismiss the gender or some other trait of the authors, or claim that statistics are just lies), @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology SHOW ME THE DATA :-D, @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology But aw oh, we can't reserve scholarships for Maori and Pacifica students because that would be discrimination, so what do you suggest Stephen?, @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology Yes I suppose, but it isn't JUST about advertising. And throwing a tiki in or using the same paragraph sounds pretty ridiculous and patronising., @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology That isn't what is being suggested though is it. What's being suggested is improve access to education/training and then groups wronged in the past will be as qualified as anyone else (except when, after they graduate, the hiring manager refuses them due to their own racism....), @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology https://t.co/mzpEGgYkF3, @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology How can you not see how ridiculous and unfair that is though?

How does that work? Families don't spontaneously generate wealth down the generations., @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology You can keep going if you like but I'm out. This keeps mushrooming and we obviously see the world very differently. Of course it is only you who have a claim on rationality though!, @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology I believe scientists should reflect the diversity of their communities. I believe science as a whole benefits as more and more voices are added to it. And I believe it is a shame to accept a lack of diversity as having no disadvantages to the science or the people., @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology 3. "Attracting, Retaining, and Preparing a Diverse Academic Engineering Workforce"\n\nFar more qualified people out there to suggest papers though. \n\nI guess the other thing is we are talking about peoples lived experiences. Experiences that neither I or you (Stephen) have had., @stho002 @j_padulles @TimCurran8 @buckleyhannah @N_J_Day @JEcology If you're in favour of increasing access to educ/training for under-represented/historically-wronged groups (I think you are from prev tweet) then by definition compromise is needed.

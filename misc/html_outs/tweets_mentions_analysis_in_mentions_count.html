      <td>[@VictoriaOldham4 @Commercial_St @Harrogatebc It s great you're showing such interest in council benches Cllr Oldham. Perhaps you could show similar interest in senior @HarrogateBC officers investigating complaints against each other &amp;amp; declaring each other blameless? Aren't councillors supposed to hold officers to account?, @BrokenBarnet That already happens on our council (@HarrogateBC). All key decisions made by cosy 7-person coterie (the Cabinet) and many other decisions delegated to (unelected, unaccountable) senior officers. This is what passes for democracy in our town., I've submitted a Freedom of Information request asking @HarrogateBC to make public all the comments it received during its "consultation" on proposed changes at Harrogate's Turkish Baths. https://t.co/rRMaqCaVyC via @whatdotheyknow, @morgim @Harrogatebc The planet they live is on Kim-Jong Cooper Planet. This is a planet where the Supreme Leader constantly gets his own way because far too many people, including his fellow councillors and local media, timidly decline to question or challenge him. It's absolutely pathetic!, @thestrayferret These are things @HarrogateBC could - and should - have been doing.  Arguably, there was absolutely no need for @BidHarrogate if HBC under the "leadership" of Kim-Jong Cooper and Wallace Sampson "OBE" had been doing its job effectively., @Richard1508 @Harrogatebc I've been studying the form and it would seem to indicate that if you bet on HBC councillors to show any backbone, it's an odds-on certainty you'll lose your money!, I’ve just written to all 40 @HarrogateBC councillors highlighting the completely unsatisfactory response I’ve received from HBC Chief Executive Wallace Sampson (pictured) in relation to the @VisitHarrogate website debacle. https://t.co/SfDUED2GYY, @Harrogatebc @DenisKaye @BidHarrogate @thestrayferret @HgateAdvertiser I'm sure that proviso will have been buried in the small print. But come on James, if an event has been held successfully for several years with no problems or concerns, it's not unreasonable that those booking space for the following year expect &amp;amp; assume the event will go ahead., Interesting that @JWebsterLDR reports on this story, but persistently ignores the on-going story that senior @HarrogateBC officers "investigate" complaints about other senior HBC officers &amp;amp; invariably declare them blameless. @yorkshirepost https://t.co/mif0k4R3wl, And let's not forget the former @Welcome2Yorks board members who clearly failed to ask pertinent, probing questions of former CEO Gary Verity. One was @HarrogateBC Leader "Kim-Jong" Cooper who, curiously enough, is not at all keen on probing questions about his own regime. https://t.co/4X80FC4KnF, It's very disappointing that @HKLibDems (supposedly the official Opposition party on @HarrogateBC) haven't taken a much stronger lead in asking questions about the Christmas Market debacle., @harrogate_stuff @thestrayferret @Harrogatebc But sadly @HarrogateBC isn't being abolished because of its countless shortcomings. But because the Government seems to think carving up local government in North Yorkshire will cut costs &amp;amp; improve efficiency. Trouble is, HBC is likely to be replaced by a body that's even worse!, What utter baloney. It’s also incredibly arrogant. It’s not about what Ms Norton thinks. It’s about  @HarrogateBC’s residents &amp;amp; Council Tax-payers having full trust &amp;amp; confidence in the way HBC’s legal department deals with complaints., The state of @HarrogateBC.  The Deputy Leader referring to residents as "noise" because he doesn't happen  to agree with them.  The legal chief allowed to "investigate" a complaint about her own boss &amp;amp; claim it's a completely impartial process.  Does HBC have no standards at all?, @roguehorsedeal @HgateAdvertiser @MReederDigital That's very kind Mr Dealer. I think there's some truth in that. That unlike @HgateAdvertiser which tends to shy away or even completely ignore stories critical of @HarrogateBC, I'm happy to confront, probe &amp;amp; question what I see as HBC's many shortcomings., @RobertBeaumont @RyedaleDC @Harrogatebc He certainly has no shame., It seems my Code of Conduct complaint against @HarrogateBC Cabinet member Cllr Stanley Lumley, for his alleged obstructiveness in answering questions re HBC’s public consultation on proposed changes at @turkishbaths, is to be determined by HBC legal chief Jennifer Norton., But really, @thestrayferret needs to significantly improve its coverage of @HarrogateBC where there are serious &amp;amp; multiple governance issues. There's also a rise in Cabinet members holding "informal" (i.e. secret) meetings with officers. Yet completely unreported by the Ferret., You have to question @thestrayferret's editorial judgement when it finds time to report on no delays to rail services but ignores complaint made to @LGOmbudsman about 3 senior @HarrogateBC officers, including CEO, refusing to answer questions about how HBC spends public money., @GHRHarrogate @Harrogatebc Has Cllr Cooper lost the ability to speak proper English -or have you just misquoted him? I can't believe he actually said: "A few things had gotten off track, they're now back on track.", I can't get to grips with @JWebsterLDR's coverage of @HarrogateBC. One minute he seems interested and writes quite a detailed, informative story. The next minute he doesn't want to know and turns a blind eye. Where's the consistency? @JGibbins @MReederDigital, @HarrogateBC’s legal department is a disgrace. If you make a complaint against legal chief Jennifer Norton, she decides who “investigates” it. Chooses one of her own team who (of course) finds in her favour. And then she approves &amp;amp; endorses the findings. You couldn’t make it up!, People may not be aware but as @HarrogateBC’s Head of Legal &amp;amp; Governance, Jennifer Norton holds an incredibly influential position, with the power to hold all other officers (and all councillors) to account. So shouldn’t she ensure that her own conduct is always exemplary?, @Youngy13895080 @Harrogatebc I think in this carefully-considered plan from @northyorkscc &amp;amp; HBC, cars miraculously disappear as, obviously, they're not really necessary (other than for Really Important People like Wallace Sampson "OBE"); and why does anyone need a taxi when it's far healthier to walk?, @thestrayferret Why is @HarrogateBC still insisting that it should ratify this West of Harrogate Parameters Plan when HBC is about to be abolished? It means the body (and councillors) who make the decision will never be held accountable for its consequences., @WillRobertsTDF @thestrayferret Some of us have been constant and vociferous critics of @HarrogateBC. Curiously though our comments are never quoted by @thestrayferret, @HgateAdvertiser or Harrogate's supposedly "completely impartial",  BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporter @JWebsterLDR., @ClareDelders @cllrbridget @themjcouk Interesting to hear a councillor say meetings have been "working perfectly well online."  But what do the public think? In my view, remote meetings offer already secretive councils like @HarrogateBC the opportunity to be even less transparent &amp;amp; accountable than usual., @RobertBeaumont @VisitHarrogate @Harrogatebc @JWebsterLDR Presumably because @JWebsterLDR is under instructions not to cover the story? And there was I thinking that BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporters, have an obligation to be completely impartial., What is the point of #Harrogate having a BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporter (@JWebsterLDR) if he's not even on top of stories such as @HarrogateBC cancelling a swathe of committee meetings; while Cabinet members hold secret meetings with officers?, @DenisKaye @HarrogateBC claims that the Head of Legal &amp;amp; Governance, Jennifer Norton, who oversees complaints handling, has a duty to be entirely independent &amp;amp; impartial. Fact remains she still reports to the Corporate Affairs director, the Chief Executive and Supreme Leader Kim-Jong Cooper., @alanhuddart @Harrogatebc You would have thought, knowing in advance dozens of people were going to be watching the meeting a few preparations might have been made. There again, we are talking about @HarrogateBC's "communications" department  - so, frankly, I'm not in the least surprised., I see that @HarrogateBC’s engagement with @Knaresboro_BID is being led by the Head of Operations at @HgtConventions Michael Constantine. I seem to recall he very briefly sat on the board of @BidHarrogate before being swiftly removed. Not exactly a ringing endorsement., I think we also need to be told exactly how much time Cooper is managing to devote to his full-time, taxpayer-funded job when he has so many other (conflicting) responsibilities: @HarrogateBC councillor, Leader of HBC, @northyorkscc councillor, chairman of @HgtConventions etc., I've still to receive a convincing explanation from @HarrogateBC as to why it originally claimed it received "well over 1,500 responses" to its public consultation on @turkishbaths. And then last month claimed the figure was 325 responses., @TylerReetonNYCC @TylerReeton Good luck with trying to bring an end to toxic party politics in #Harrogate.  Sadly, I think that's highly unlikely as long as Cllr Richard Cooper remains Leader of @HarrogateBC; and his sidekick Cllr Graham Swift continues as Deputy., Maybe the reason @HarrogateBC has been so reluctant to answer my questions about the @VisitHarrogate website contract is because of one of the queries relates to the actions (or lack of them) by Chief Exec Wallace Sampson &amp;amp; HBC Cabinet member Cllr Stan Lumley? https://t.co/wnaMsm4PtL, @dodgyrodgespiv "Vision" seems to be a popular word among council chief executives. @HarrogateBC Chief Exec Wallace Sampson made a big thing about Vision 2020. Then midway through 2018 when he realised there was no chance of delivering on his stated objectives, it suddenly became 2024 Programme!, @thestrayferret All very well for Opposition councillors to criticize @HarrogateBC for its culture of secrecy. But how often have these councillors actually challenged HBC's legal dept when it claims documents &amp;amp; information are confidential &amp;amp; exempt from disclosure?  Answer: hardly ever., The ever-gullible &amp;amp; obsequious @HgateAdvertiser applauds another report claiming the UCI cycling event was a huge success. Needless to say the paper has never demanded answers from @HarrogateBC on the event's many failings including wrecking the West Park Stray for nearly a year. https://t.co/mf3sPZdJLI, Of course I was told if residents are unhappy with how @HarrogateBC deals with complaints, they can always appeal to @LGOmbudsman. Fat lot of good that will do. In my experience LGO will dream up any old excuse for not pursuing a complaint. No wonder HBC recommends the Ombudsman!, @JWebsterLDR Well done Jacob. Every story seems to come from a meeting or @HarrogateBC press release. Do you never think of asking questions or, even better, digging out your own stories (like journalists used to do)?, As if @HgateAdvertiser wasn’t poor enough already with its persistent reluctance to properly cover @HarrogateBC and hold its senior officers &amp;amp; councillors to account. Who does it imagine will buy the paper if it’s not even focusing squarely on its own patch?, Interesting that "holding the powerful to account" @thestrayferret has done nothing to follow up on @HarrogateBC's preposterous claim that no local companies were capable of creating new @VisitHarrogate website - but at least we now know how to cook smoked haddock with celeriac! https://t.co/bVaOZlsQTT, For Mr Sturdy’s benefit, @HarrogateBC allows senior officers to “investigate” complaints against each other. It has a so-called "Independent Person" who it only allows to engage with HBC’s legal chief (not the public.) Hardly independent then!, @RobertBeaumont @DenisKaye @Harrogatebc @HgateAdvertiser @thestrayferret @JWebsterLDR @Jgibbins It's what you're paid to do @JWebsterLDR.  Sorry to be so blunt, but if you're not interested in holding @HarrogateBC to account, you should perhaps consider doing something else. #Harrogate residents have had enough of this arrogant, secretive, obstructive council., Surely we're not STILL talking about splashing out £49 million redeveloping @HgtConventions?  @HarrogateBC's useless councillors had the opportunity to invest heavily in the town's prime asset years &amp;amp; years ago - but failed to. To do so now would be a complete waste of money. https://t.co/fz5UL70Is3, @DenisKaye @Harrogatebc @HGchamber He should have been sent packing months &amp;amp; months ago. But he survives because fellow Tory councillors are too timid to stand up to him; an embarrassingly poor "Opposition" (@HKLibDems); an absolutely hopeless scrutiny committee (chaired by a LibDem) and a spineless local media., @harrogate_stuff @clarkjames70 @Harrogatebc @LibDems @HKLibDems @CllrPatMarsh Well, we can remove them at the ballot box. But then we should also take that opportunity to remove the vast majority of Tory councillors currently sitting on @HarrogateBC &amp;amp; doing nothing (constructive) on behalf of the people they claim to represent. This town is in the mire., @HarrogateBC's Chief Executive Wallace Sampson "OBE" (pictured) is ultimately responsible for the way the Council is operated and managed. It's time he provided some credible answers. https://t.co/z4Bv4G67rZ, @Harrogatebc Now that you've set a precedent about getting straight to the point &amp;amp; holding your hands up,  perhaps you'll do  the same &amp;amp; answer all outstanding questions about why you splurged £165K on new @VisitHarrogate website and made the decision behind closed doors?, Very interesting (and unexpected) revelation from @HarrogateBC Leader Kim-Jong Cooper. It seems he's now a  passionate believer in councillors "doing the honourable thing." So, from now on, I suggest we should all judge him and his colleagues on this basis &amp;amp; see how they fare!, I believe the position of at least one senior @HarrogateBC officer is becoming increasingly untenable. It can't go on like this., @Harrogatebc Thank you for your response Mr Sherwood. But why are there no items to bring before committees? Is everything now being decided by council officers?, The Tory MP for York Outer, @JulianSturdy has claimed that @CityofYork is “unfit for purpose.” Goodness me, where does that leave @HarrogateBC?, @thestrayferret I can't see any mention of what will happen to @HarrogateBC's £17m council offices. Also the idiocy of approving the building in the first place. It will now become another white elephant - rather like @HgtConventions. What brilliant leadership we have in this town! @JWebsterLDR, @RobParsonsYP @yorkshirepost Oh the irony of @HarrogateBC Supreme Leader Richard Cooper having the gall of accusing other councillors of being involved in a stitch-up!!!!!, I've now received the report on proposed changes at #Harrogate's @TurkishBaths from @HarrogateBC Cabinet member Cllr Stanley Lumley. No apology of course for failing to keep his word. The arrogance of the man. But then sadly, that's a familiar trait within HBC's highest echelons. https://t.co/KkeDZg6aaW, @roguehorsedeal @the_tpa @neal_stamp Absolutely outrageous the amount of money some of these senior council officers get paid (plus all the perks).  And then, just to rub salt in the wound, council chief executives such as @HarrogateBC's Wallace Sampson "OBE" appear to be almost completely unaccountable., @DenisKaye: I’m very happy for others to join me in probing &amp;amp; questioning the way @HarrogateBC is operated. And, let’s be clear, change will only be achieved if the cause is taken up by as many people as poss. Not least as you say by councillors who are supposed to represent us. https://t.co/as0O43mfAC, @Commercial_St @Harrogatebc Much better. Perhaps you could now give tips to @HarrogateBC on how it could clean up the whole town?, @HGchamber @HarrogateBC's Deputy Leader Graham Swift has been speaking about this for nearly four years.  And what has he got to show for this initiative?......Er, nothing. (This is the same Cllr Swift who famously claimed: "Tourism can look after itself."), @gordiegorgor @Harrogatebc There is something fundamentally wrong with a system whereby if you make a formal complaint against the council's Chief Executive, he gets to choose which officers "investigate" that complaint -  both of whom report to him., @kristianj23 There's  no danger of any @HgateAdvertiser or @thestrayferret reporter being  jailed for running embarrassing stories about @HarrogateBC.   Quite content it seems to be unquestioning &amp;amp; obsequious., @dodgyrodgespiv @LGOmbudsman @Harrogatebc @VisitHarrogate The (pathetic) reason is that  I'm unable to prove that I've suffered "significant personal injustice as a direct result of @HarrogateBC's actions."  This is ludicrous. The reason I complained to LGSCO is because HBC councillors are failing  to hold HBC officers to account., Who at @HarrogateBC is responsible for deciding what information is placed in the public domain and what information is declared “exempt from disclosure”? Answer: Monitoring Officer Jennifer Norton and her deputy Peter Atkinson., @RobertBeaumont @Harrogatebc @HGchamber @AJonesMP Well that's what @HgateAdvertiser and @thestrayferret should be doing day after day. Instead, they seem to have adopted a spineless, sycophantic approach where nothing's ever questioned. And, to their shame, those who do try &amp;amp; hold the Council to account are steadfastly ignored., @ItsOurCity1 @ItsOurCitySheff @HelpSheffield Good luck. We need the same in #Harrogate. Cabinet-run councils are fundamentally undemocratic and actively encourage council leaders to become dictatorial. @HarrogateBC's Cabinet members are now starting to hold meetings with officers in private with no agenda - &amp;amp; no minutes!, Andrew Jones and @HarrogateBC Leader Kim-Jong Cooper knew full well that using the Stray for ad hoc commercial purposes is prohibited under Stray Act. And that @mhclg had made it quite clear it wouldn't permit any more dispensations. So blame should be directed at Jones &amp;amp; Cooper., @maggieboyd62 @HgtConventions Some would argue that no organisation knows more about wasting public money than @HarrogateBC. Why don't we talk about the millions frittered away on HBC's completely unnecessary new offices - now destined to become the town's second white elephant., @Harrogatebc Thank you Mr Sherwood., @DenisKaye @Harrogatebc @AJonesMP And yet people still affect to look puzzled &amp;amp; baffled when I say there are serious &amp;amp; multiple governance issues at @HarrogateBC., @thestrayferret When you say "transform @HarrogateBC's former headquarters into offices"...........the building was offices - council offices.  So if we're now being told it's such a good building to work from, why did HBC need to sell it and splurge £17m on some ghastly replacement?, @harrogate_stuff @Harrogatebc @against_bid @BidHarrogate @northyorkscc @LGAcomms I think that's what Sampson was probably thinking. Keep extending the deadline (no doubt he'll want to extend it again because of Covid?) - by which time he'll be comfortably retired on a fat pension and won't care less. (Not that he's cared that much up until now.), @CfGScrutiny If @HarrogateBC was one of those councils which told you its scrutiny committee "works hard to involve &amp;amp; engage the public in its work", you can take it from me, that's totally untrue. It makes no effort at all to engage the public., I trust @HgateAdvertiser, @thestrayferret &amp;amp; #Harrogate’s BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporter @JWebsterLDR will be appalled at this clumsy attempt by @HarrogateBC to prevent awkward questions being asked at meetings by denouncing &amp;amp; rejecting them as “defamatory &amp;amp; offensive”. https://t.co/171dKNpy0m, Lots of criticism in this week’s @HgateAdvertiser from local bars &amp;amp; coffeeshops complaining about @HarrogateBC’s sluggishness in dealing with requests to use pavements as seating areas., @RobertBeaumont @thestrayferret @Harrogatebc It also demonstrates a complete lack of consistency if you run a story which criticises Cllr John Mann. But stubbornly ignore one which raises serious criticisms of HBC Chief Executive Wallace Sampson "OBE". Strikes me as a curious (&amp;amp; worrying) editorial judgement., Also when is @HarrogateBC Chief Executive Wallace Sampson going to "do the honourable thing" and provide credible answers to questions about the shenanigans surrounding £165,000 @VisitHarrogate website contract?, Good to see @HarrogateBC councillor @VictoriaOldham4 "liking" the tweet: "What's confidential in local government?" But it does raise the question, if that's her true feeling, why hasn't she been leading the calls for HBC to be so much more open, transparent &amp;amp; accountable"?, @RelicYorkshire @Harrogatebc @thestrayferret @HgtConventions Indeed. And Mr Sampson still hasn't provided a satisfactory answer as to why HBC bypassed tendering process in relation to @VisitHarrogate contract. And why he appeared to be under the impression that there were no suitably-qualified web design companies in whole of #Yorkshire!, @against_bid If this was the first occasion Ms Bowles and other senior officers at @HarrogateBC had adopted an obstructive &amp;amp; unhelpful approach in dealing with questions, I would be rather more sympathetic. But it's time &amp;amp; time &amp;amp; time again - almost as if it's an approved Council policy., @Colpeper @thestrayferret Based on that performance, you wouldn't leave him in charge of a whelk stall, let alone be chair of an important council committee." As for his comment "Without playing politics........" Yes, of course Cllr Mann, Tories on @HarrogateBC never, ever "play politics" do they?, @Harrogatebc Do you think this is being helpful Mr Sherwood? Or are you following the poor example set by your boss, Director of Corporate Affairs Rachel Bowles? I asked you a direct question. I expect a direct answer, please., @HarrogateBC's scrutiny committee needs to undertake an urgent review of the way the Council's legal department operates as it, allegedly, gives every impression of being completely out of control., The state of @HarrogateBC. It's bad enough that legal chief Jennifer Norton contemplates rejecting questions posed by residents to ask in person at HBC meetings. But now it seems she doesn't want to tell councillors that the (rejected) questions were even submitted., From @theyorkmix: "Councillor denies falling asleep during York planning meeting." If they're anything like @HarrogateBC planning meetings, it would be a bigger surprise if anyone was awake! https://t.co/sVigF5dcXa, Make no mistake, this is a defeat for @HarrogateBC Supreme Leader Kim-Jong Cooper who was vehemently opposed to live-streaming of council meetings.  The very thought of residents being able to see for themselves how lamentably poor so many of our councillors are. https://t.co/ipDAGz3mIG, @thestrayferret If @HarrogateBC was really serious about wanting to reduce its carbon footprint, it shouldn't have spent £17m building new offices for itself when, arguably, there was no good reason to., @thestrayferret makes itself look ridiculous. It boldly claims: “Our journalists will hold those in power to account”. And yet when @HarrogateBC’s Leader Kim-Jong Cooper is publicly questioned about HBC’s straightforwardness, the Ferret ignores the story., @PinewoodsHgt @LizzieABrewster And didn't the Leader of @HarrogateBC "Kim-Jong" Cooper recently claim to be "passionate" about protecting the environment?  .........Clearly not the environment in and around Harrogate's main shopping streets., With @HKLibDems' candidate Hannah Gostlow victorious in yesterday's @HarrogateBC by-election, there are now 10 Opposition councillors - exactly a quarter of the Council.  Time one feels (albeit long overdue) for the Opposition to start making an impact. https://t.co/NZgdoqsyWy, I believe the position of one of @HarrogateBC's most senior officers is becoming increasingly untenable. How can residents have any confidence in a complaints system where the officer with the power to rule on complaints is often the officer who is the subject of complaints?, @Porchester1929 @kenningtonkitty @CarlisleConsGrp @TheCityBaths @Fusion_LS @SallyDavis09 @TurkishBaths There was a £300,000 restoration in 2018 which was funded by @HarrogateBC. Before that, there was a major £1.5m refurbishment in 2003 which was jointly funded by HBC and the Heritage Lottery Fund., @thestrayferret @Harrogatebc If HBC hadn't spent £17m on these ugly offices, it might have had a bit more money to spare., It’s heartening to know @HarrogateBC’s corporate affairs director Rachel Joyce is taking such a close interest in HBC's Constitution &amp;amp; is able to quote sections whenever it suits her. I hope she’s taking particular note of part 5 which covers the responsibilities of HBC officers., @lgcplus Why not have an award for the Least Transparent &amp;amp; Least Accountable Council of the Year? In which case, can I nominate @HarrogateBC, with a special mention for its Chief Executive Wallace Sampson who's done so much to contribute to this nomination., @roguehorsedeal @Harrogatebc @Knaresboro_BID @HgtConventions @BidHarrogate @TurkishBaths It's the Chief Executive's job to hold his officers to account. And it's the job of councillors to hold the Chief Executive to account. It's a shame so many of the people associated with the operation &amp;amp; management of @HarrogateBC appear so reluctant to do their jobs properly., @thestrayferret It's strange the way @HKLibDems' leader @cllrpatmarsh calls for an investigation into some things but completely ignores others. No calls from her for an investigation into @HarrogateBC's legal department &amp;amp; alleged serious &amp;amp; multiple failings in HBC's governance procedures., @roguehorsedeal @Harrogatebc @Knaresboro_BID @HgtConventions @BidHarrogate And that's not the only reason he's got for feeling ever-so-slightly-awkward. This is the same Michael Constantine who I proved last week provided misleading information about @HarrogateBC's public consultation on @turkishbaths., There's far too many decisions being made by @HarrogateBC Cabinet members at private meetings with HBC officers, with no Opposition members present and therefore no opportunity to raise questions &amp;amp; concerns. Makes a complete mockery of the idea that we have a democratic council., ...]</td>

I appreciate the support., Proud to stand with the patriots in Woodbury who #BackTheBlue!\n\nWe must END the dangerous anti-law enforcement climate created by Dems like @TinaSmithMN.\n\nAbolishing the police won’t make our communities safer.\n\nWe need the good men &amp;amp; women of law enforcement now more than ever! https://t.co/WpqhUhM0FR, As your Senator, I will codify @realDonaldTrump's exec. order giving localities the authority to choose whether they accept refugees. \n\nIt was never the fed. govt.'s right to usurp home rule in the first place. @TinaSmithMN should be doing this right NOW!\n\nhttps://t.co/BrBwkFf6u1, Democrats: “Trump’s rhetoric is divisive and hateful and he’s a liar!”\n\nAlso Democrats: “If Republicans win, people will die!”\n\nSo say power hungry radicals like @MinnesotaDFL Chairman @kenmartin73 and Senator @TinaSmithMN.\n\nPeople are sick of the fear-mongering and vile rhetoric https://t.co/mnuEUsvuTm, On the #GreenNewDeal, friendly reminder that Senator @TinaSmithMN voted "PRESENT" rather than voting "NO" when it was up for a vote. But that's par for the course for her. \n\nIron Range, Enbridge employees...learn to code and find another job in Joe &amp;amp; Tina's America! #Debates2020, What is Minnesota's #1 export? Iron ore? Cheese? Paul Bunyan?\n\nNope! It's looting, arson, anarchy, chaos &amp;amp; lawlessness.\n\nThe nationwide unrest we're seeing started in Minneapolis because of the dereliction of duty &amp;amp; inflammatory rhetoric from @TinaSmithMN, @MayorFrey &amp;amp; @Tim_Walz! https://t.co/FoFjTcXqTR, Even liberal legal scholar Larry Tribe called Schumer’s dangerous threats to SCOTUS ‘inexcusable.’ Chief Justice Roberts has rebuked minority leader and, again, I call on @TinaSmithMN to do the same. https://t.co/0SVH2JIxSR via @YouTube, Another peaceful protest tonight in Louisville results in two police officer being shot.\n\nI condemn it, @TinaSmithMN won’t. #BackTheBlue https://t.co/tul1Vpp0Lr, Even if you're a qualified, trained, certified doctor as Senator Jensen is. And why? \n\nBecause it's politically beneficial for @JoeBiden, Senator @TinaSmithMN, and the Democrats for all of us to buy into their fear-mongering and buy into this lockdown on our liberties., It's now painfully clear @TinaSmithMN lacks any morality.\n\n@KamalaHarris encouraged donations to a fund that bailed an alleged MN child rapist out of jail. A fund @JoeBiden campaign staff donated $ to.\n\nTina refuses to denounce this. Doesn't get much worse https://t.co/5KVSBj50yG, It’s been decades since Minnesota farmers have had their voices heard in the US Senate.\n\n@TinaSmithMN has never seen a regulation she didn’t support, regardless of the MN families hurt by them!\n\nWhen I get to Washington DC they’ll finally be heard again.\nhttps://t.co/w53Q96yXmU, .@TinaSmithMN just how disingenuous can you get??\n\nAlmost half your campaign money comes from corporate PACs &amp;amp; Washington DC lobbyists. Sorry, but we’re not buying it. \n\nWe should start calling you “Miss PAC man.” https://t.co/e1i4JV3xlH, Dems want a Supreme Court that will implement their radical agenda, NOT uphold the Constitution.\n\nThat's why @TinaSmithMN prematurely pledged to block Judge Barrett &amp;amp; @JoeBiden refuses to release his list of judges.\n\nNEITHER will denounce plans to pack the Court!\n\nNot on my watch https://t.co/zBb6LCB6I6, I'm proud/humbled to have the endorsement of Iron Range Democrats, who rightly recognize the Dems in D.C. &amp;amp; the Twin Cities (like Senator @TinaSmithMN), have left them and their way of life behind in pursuit of far left radicalism. \n\nI back the Range 100%!\nhttps://t.co/PxQD0dc6dZ, Just wrapped up a 10 day campaign swing through Northern MN! \n\nMeanwhile @TinaSmithMN continues to be #HunkeredInHennepin.\n\nI’m sure Tina &amp;amp; @AngieCraigMN virtually drinking tea/beer will REALLLY bring back the working class voters the @MinnesotaDFL has abandoned &amp;amp; written off 🙄 https://t.co/PavOMgJhgT, .@TinaSmithMN won’t answer whether she supports her fellow radical DFL’ers’ legislation to outlaw mining because in actuality she is vehemently anti mining, plain &amp;amp; simple. \n\nTina wants to try to fool the hardworking men &amp;amp; women on the Iron Range. But we’re all smarter than that. https://t.co/DrLJwnTE7U, .@JoeBiden would like you to forget he's been in politics for the last 50 years, &amp;amp; has said and done a lot of horrible things during that time. \n\nAmong them: openly worrying about potentially negative impacts from de-segregation. Sick!\n\nAnd @TinaSmithMN supports this man?! Unreal https://t.co/AUA9b5LAKY, Thanks for all the hard work out on the doors today, team!

She might not support you, but I do! https://t.co/187HqRD1Pw, Tonight we heard Biden refuse to say he’d hold China accountable for giving us COVID &amp;amp; taking advantage of us economically.\n\nThe "Manchurian Candidate" @TinaSmithMN is no better! \n\nShe owns stock in Chinese companies/takes big $ from corporations that outsource jobs there #debate, Do @TinaSmithMN &amp;amp; @JoeBiden support packing the court? Biden said "you'll find out after the election."\n\nWhen asked about it, Tina said "I'm not going to go there." \n\nWhen will the media do their jobs &amp;amp; GO THERE?!\n\nHere's her phone number, give her a call sometime! (651) 221-1016, How do you know @KamalaHarris and @TinaSmithMN are colleagues and friends?\n\nThey both always dodge the question on whether or not they support the #GreenNewDeal &amp;amp;abolishing fossil fuel (even though Harris sponsored it).\n\nIron Range: learn to code under a Biden/Harris/Smith admin!, Minnesota was once a reliably blue state, but not anymore.\n\nWith the DFL’s radical plunge into Socialism and lawlessness, folks are fleeing the Democrat Party.\n\nThey see the results delivered by @realDonaldTrump and they want more!\n\nWe’re going to send @TinaSmithMN packing! https://t.co/obHAFeZWNM, The @MinnesotaDFL has every reason to be concerned.\n\nThey’ve turned their backs on workers, farmers, the iron range, school children, suburban families, law enforcement, &amp;amp; small business owners.\n\nAll in order to peddle the radical progressive policies of @IlhanMN &amp;amp; @TinaSmithMN. https://t.co/6TEJTlQ2e7, It’s been a very long time since Minnesota had a competitive Senate race.\n\nThe polls are tightening and momentum is building.\n\nUnlike @TinaSmithMN, who only fights the highest bidder, I will fight for YOU!\nhttps://t.co/CGgo0VGCsU, Tune in TODAY at 11:30am to watch my debate w/ @TinaSmithMN at @MNFarmfest.\n\nFrom trade deals to tax cuts to repealing WOTUS, I've been a strong advocate for MN farmers.\n\nMeanwhile Sen. Smith has been MIA.\n\nRegister below to watch it live or listen on @wccoradio!, @JudyRademacher4 @TinaSmithMN We are trying to help the churches and the parishioners, Judy. We have filed a lawsuit against MN in federal court for violating the Constitution. Stay tuned., The Radical Left wants to abolish the police, and now they want to take away your guns (but that's nothing new), by trying to abolish the @NRA.\n\nThey want you to be helpless and susceptible to the mob.  \n\n@JoeBiden &amp;amp; Senator @TinaSmithMN continue to go along with this lunacy. https://t.co/hhAA4qy2Rh, Thank you @realDonaldTrump for reminding people that @JoeBiden’s staffers gave big money to bail the Minneapolis looters and arsonists out of prison.\n\nA move that @TinaSmithMN refuses to denounce. Disgraceful! And the media refuses to ask her about it.\n#TulsaRally #TrumpRally2020, 49 Senators including @TinaSmithMN voted for more witnesses.\n\nThereby saying they don’t currently have enough evidence to render a verdict.\n\nYet nearly all of them voted to convict in the #ImpeachmentVote. \n\nSeems to me they should have abstained! Hypocrites, all. #ImpeachmentDay, Just left Duluth where I was with @realDonaldTrump.\n\nThe chickens are coming home to roost for @TinaSmithMN &amp;amp; the @MinnesotaDFL on the Iron Range, where they’ve forsaken the Northland way of life w/ years of hostility toward mining, logging, energy &amp;amp; good paying jobs!#DuluthRally https://t.co/lA0AP4KDQq, So sorry we can’t get together in person for @MNFarmfest this year.\n\nHere I am w/ @SecretarySonny at LAST year’s FarmFest!\n\nI AM looking forward to virtual FarmFest this week including my debate w/ Senator @TinaSmithMN tomorrow.\n\nSign up to watch live!👇\nhttps://t.co/oeVobQQVqr https://t.co/iYq4Kcapa4, A vote for @JoeBiden &amp;amp; @TinaSmithMN is a vote to OUTLAW mining on the Iron Range &amp;amp; rob Northlanders of an economic renaissance.\n\nFrom copper-nickel to iron ore, Democrats are going after it ALL.\n\nThey’ve cynically sacrificed the Range for political power. https://t.co/Ptogcaqv8r, @tankconst @TinaSmithMN Help is on the way if we are successful, Bryan. We were in Tower a couple of times, stopped in to Good ol' days Bar &amp;amp; Grill., My opponent, current US Senator @TinaSmithMN not only supports late term abortion.\n\nShe made a living as a Planned Parenthood executive.\n\nThe right to life must be defended! #ProLife #ProtectLife #SOTU #StateOfTheUnion https://t.co/5s2iR2UXUE, In case you missed it, in yesterday's @MPRnews debate, @TinaSmithMN: \n\n❌Refused to condemn ANTIFA\n❌Ripped into the police\n❌Refused to explain why she's blocking COVID relief\n❌Continued her opposition to mining, energy (@minnesotans4L3) &amp;amp; logging jobs https://t.co/RNagjUydVf, The #DefundThePolice movement has created a toxic culture where violence against police is encouraged.\n\nAnd Democrats like @TinaSmithMN are adding to it by recklessly undermining law enforcement.\n\nThis cannot stand &amp;amp; WILL NOT when I’m you’re next Senator!\nhttps://t.co/2RnOUKBuuD, ICYMI catch my interview with @esmemurphy below.\n\nWe covered many important topics including @realDonaldTrump’s surge in the polls in MN, @TinaSmithMN raking in the cash from multinational corporations, &amp;amp; Democrats’ COVID power grab.\n\nWatch it here👇👇\nhttps://t.co/zYGFauweiN, Lots of news today on Senator Burr’s stock sales. \n\nYet Senator @TinaSmithMN sold nearly $1 mill dollars’ worth of stocks almost 2 months ago. She must come clean on what she knew &amp;amp; when she knew it. NOW!\n\nMN media is helping her sweep it under the rug but we’re not letting up! https://t.co/0LVzQkDGjx, .@TinaSmithMN is reliant on massive donations (over $40k!) from corporations that outsource to China.\n\nNo wonder she refuses to hold China accountable—she likes their money!\n\nRemind me, is she the Senator from Manchuria or the Senator from Minnesota? 🤔\nhttps://t.co/dUXAPGXbb5, On #TrumpTownHall POTUS set a goal of 94% antibiotic production to occur here in the U.S.👏🏻👏🏻\n\nU.S. has been too dependent on supply chains in China for too long- which I discuss in this commercial.\n\n@TinaSmithMN can’t even admit the virus STARTED THERE!\n\nhttps://t.co/CV6PL2N5Rz, The people of Minnesota are behind you! And I can’t wait to join you in DC to fight for them.\n\nMinnesota is ready for a Senator who will work with @realDonaldTrump on jobs, the Iron Range, and Law &amp;amp; Order.\n\nAll @TinaSmithMN does is obstruct progress &amp;amp; hurt Minnesota’s workers! https://t.co/M0FjZdCGBP, Yet another example of @TinaSmithMN's failed leadership!\n\nIn 2008, she opposed a proposal requiring protests with 25+ people to apply for a permit.\n\nHad that been in place/enforced, law enforcement could've stopped the looting and riots before they began!https://t.co/URtlPtGt9q, Great rally in Stillwater with @KarinHousley pushing early voting, which you should take full advantage of! \n\nI also discussed the need to #FillTheSeatNOW and blasted @TinaSmithMN and the Dems’ radical plan to pack the court. \n\nTheir assault on our institutions is unprecedented. https://t.co/eN4mBvtjvB, Sure...said she’d ‘fix’ health care. Wrong. Said she wouldn’t just go after Trump. Supported impeachment. Now silent on bankrupting MN. She &amp;amp; @TinaSmithMN think Planned Parenthood ‘essential’ but not out- patient surgery. Really?? https://t.co/sW4cAjOX8Q, I’m sick &amp;amp; tired of the suggestion anyone fighting to #ReopenMN is ‘selfish’.\n\nThere is nothing selfish about ensuring your kids are fed!\n\nMN towns are on the brink of losing everything, yet @TinaSmithMN &amp;amp; @GovTimWalz aren’t doing a damn thing about it!https://t.co/kyC2oBwDY5, .@TinaSmithMN wants to roll back the tax cuts I helped pass &amp;amp; RAISE TAXES ON EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN! \n\nWhy does the left find economic prosperity &amp;amp; a booming economy so unacceptable? Other than the fact @realDonaldTrump is getting the credit. She's gotta go in 2020. \n\n#LewisForMN https://t.co/hu7vuL8krH, Illegal immigration hurts MN.\n\n@TinaSmithMN supports criminal aliens and sanctuary cities.\n\nI support the American people and the rule of law.\n\nCongress must pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act.\nhttps://t.co/7gezAWLgUL, .@TinaSmithMN supports the urban elite special interests propping up her campaign. @PeteStauber, @realDonaldTrump &amp;amp; I support the MN mining industry and all the families who rely on it. #LewisForMN https://t.co/IuGDqltZhg, .@TinaSmithMN is content to stand by as radicals work to abolish the police.\n\nTry explaining that to the 1500+ business owners who had their livelihoods damaged or destroyed by rioters because police were told to stand down.\n\nSociety breaks down if public order isn’t enforced! https://t.co/v1wDuoPOP1, Yes, control human migration.\n\nClose the borders and #ReopenMN. \n\n@TinaSmithMN &amp;amp; the Dems. want to keep the borders open and MN closed. https://t.co/4G7OAiTDUu, Sad to hear the Great MN Get-Together has been cancelled. \n\nFor many, a huge % of their annual income comes from the fair! \n\nAll the more reason to #ReopenMN's economy. Whereas @TinaSmithMN's policy is to endlessly bail out, I want to get the economy humming &amp;amp; capital flowing., @TinaSmithMN courageous ‘present’ vote in support of AOC’s bizarre manifesto #GreenNewDeal—along with her opposition to the PUC approved (again) Enbridge pipeline—is just the latest in her attack on the outstate MN economy in favor of her liberal metro masters. #DemsDucked🦆 https://t.co/EtIENf0SHQ, We’ve cut @tinasmithmn’s lead to just 4% &amp;amp; shrinking!\n\nDemocrats will defund the police, censor your speech, take your guns, &amp;amp; raise your taxes.\n\n@realDonaldTrump &amp;amp; I will fight for the people of Minnesota, revive the Iron Range, &amp;amp; defend the Constitution! https://t.co/5b7w4YOF9T, Couldn’t agree more, @tinasmithmn!\n\nUnelected, liberal, activist judges legislating from the bench are a huge problem.\n\nThe future of the Court is on the ballot this November. Vote. https://t.co/9jvp6sKMIU, Farmers need our help NOW.\n\nWe need to... \n\n- re-open processing plants immediately\n- invoke the agricultural provisions in the CARES Act\n- consider extending crop insurance to livestock farmers\n\n@TinaSmithMN has failed MN farmers. This can't wait! https://t.co/9tEZ9A6sjQ, Leaving Mon. for a 6 day trip through Greater MN. We’ve traveled 30k miles.\n\nFor @TinaSmithMN? Another day hunkered in the basement talking to 7 people(literally).\n\nShe should run for Hennepin Commissioner or @IlhanMN’s seat if she has no intention of representing all 87 counties https://t.co/7bTem4ngqE, A concept Tina never understood is putting country before party. National interest before self interest. \n\nENOUGH, Senator. Enough.\n\nWe ARE all in this together. The President knows it, I know it, &amp;amp; deep down somewhere, I know you know it. Please start acting like it @TinaSmithMN https://t.co/4Waq3JPMPp, Happy Halloween boys and ghouls. @TinaSmithMN is another socialist zombie following Nancy Pelosi’s marching orders. Tina pretends to be a moderate but actually supports impeachment- Don’t be tricked, send our campaign a Halloween treat today!- https://t.co/yka0w5Rjbq 🎃 🎃 https://t.co/epInkE1EkX, Hey @TinaSmithMN, it's not hard to work with people you disagree with in times of great trial.\n\nOr even praise them when they deserve it, as President Trump does.\n\n@IlhanMN has risen to the occasion, why can’t you? https://t.co/7NxIcgrMqz, Democrats are trying to redefine what’s being proposed for the Minneapolis PD.\n\n@TinaSmithMN vaguely calls it “reimagining”\n\nBut the truth is, they are ENDING, ABOLISHING, DEFUNDING, DISMANTLING the police.\n\nIf those words scare you, GOOD—they should! What city/town is next? https://t.co/SjdoBVrSLi, Great discussion on #Line3 in Bemidji last night.\n\nThis pipeline would create 8,600 jobs &amp;amp; $19M in property tax revenue.\n\nPlus it is SAFER for the environment.\n\nAnd yet urban elites like @GovTimWalz &amp;amp; @TinaSmithMN continue to block it. \n\nI STAND WITH YOU, ENERGY WORKERS! https://t.co/sV2BY8NLvU, Publicly traded companies SHOULDN'T get PPP loan.\n\nBut @TinaSmithMN is tone deaf &amp;amp; misses the mark AGAIN (unsurprising considering she lives in a waterfront mansion).\n\nSmall biz wouldn't need as much $ if MN would lift the endless, 1 size fits all lockdown\nhttps://t.co/9YAmEPFSW5, Reminder: it was Senator @TinaSmithMN who called for more protest after days of looting and arson. It was Tina who said the role police play is “dangerously wrong.” \n\nIt was Tina Smith who endorsed @IlhanMN because she called police “rotten to the root.” https://t.co/P2AkRmOOh4, Suburban voters realize Dems like @TinaSmithMN are a threat to public safety in their communities.\n\nThey’ve seen the violence &amp;amp; anarchy when Democrats defund the police &amp;amp; allow mob rule.\n\nI will always fight for law enforcement &amp;amp; safety in every community!https://t.co/SZPIwKt91f, There are many differences between @realdonaldtrump and the Democrats.\n\nBut I don’t understand how Democrats like @TinaSmithMN can hate him so much they can’t celebrate things like record low unemployment, a record setting stock market, and energy independence???\n#SOTU, Spoke to the Itasca GOP last night about how @realDonaldTrump is tackling the issues &amp;amp; picking the fights that have been put off for decades. Unlike my opponent @TinaSmithMN, #POTUS and I are fighting like hell for good paying energy, mining and timber jobs on the Iron Range!! https://t.co/UUSV9E1fIe, As urban liberals encourage riots &amp;amp; protests, people are being driven out of the city &amp;amp; the DFL.\n\nMinnesotans want public order restored!\n\nSo no, @TinaSmithMN, the police do not play "a dangerous role in society," nor should we "reimagine" policing! \nhttps://t.co/rufjycVDyb, .@MPRnews debate: When asked by the moderator if she supports packing the U.S. Supreme Court, Senator @TinaSmithMN said "I'm not gonna go there." \n\nShe sounds like @JoeBiden, she either doesn't know what she's talking about or she's willfully hiding the ball on her radicalism., Just like her cohort on the radical left (@TinaSmithMN)...@IlhanMN is an urban elitist who has the gall to tell MN miners they can no longer earn a living. \n\nOmar doesn’t even represent the Iron Range! Amazing &amp;amp; sad the lengths the radical left will go to to kill rural MN jobs. https://t.co/df8NhyQoEO, I know @TinaSmithMN will disagree, having referenced riots like these as “righteous.”\n\nBut it seems like a Molotov cocktail is a really odd thing to bring to a peaceful protest. https://t.co/ooTPMwTGUI, What Minneapolis really needs, Senator @TinaSmithMN?\n\nIs for you to NOT call MN racist and call for continued protests (after 3 nights of looting and arson) as you did at the press conference this morning. \n\nFurther violence denigrates the cause of #JusticeForGeorge.\n\n#riots2020 https://t.co/7n3gbEBciL, Thank you ⁦@TinaSmithMN⁩, ⁦@Mark_Dayton⁩ &amp;amp; ⁦@GovTimWalz⁩. https://t.co/pmWpFlvplS, Really, @AngieCraigMN? Apparently multimillionaire @TinaSmithMN thinks this deadly pandemic is a good selling opportunity. This is a disturbing new development.\n\nWhat did Tina know and when did she know it? Look forward to getting to the bottom of it. https://t.co/WFnlSbO5oB https://t.co/QR0Vne0keh, The excitement all across Minnesota for @realdonaldtrump &amp;amp; our campaign is palpable.\n\nThe people of MN have been loyal to the DFL for decades, sadly Democrats like @TinaSmithMN have not been loyal to the people.\n\nIt’s time to return Minnesotan’s values &amp;amp; voices to the US Senate! https://t.co/53txQDkOVS, How does @TinaSmithMN and @MinnesotaDFL push impeachment inquiry before they see any transcript evidence but instead rely on hearsay from another deep state permanent plant. Oh, wait..they (and Dem media allies) tried it with false Russian collusion story. Unhinged hate., Thief River Falls ➡️ Crookston ➡️ East Grand Forks\n\nUnlike @TinaSmithMN who’s #HunkeredInHennepin I promise to be the voice of all Minnesotans! https://t.co/F1SglvJLeB, Senator @TinaSmithMN is NOT the person we want voting on Supreme Court confirmations.\n\nThis has gone beyond simply debating the second amendment. \n\nThe left wants you completely helpless, vulnerable, and susceptible to the mob.

But people say a vote for a Libertarian candidate is wasted."\n\nThat assumes one's vote has any realistic chance of determining the election - which is only true for small local elections at best, @Keptsosterone @reason Fixing inequality means that your have no right to be different lest that lead to inequality !!\n\nSuch total a equality view will necessarily violate equality of rights voiding the concept of equality, @reason OFFICIAL criticism aimed at other countries (such as China) can easily open the door for foreign interventionism – assuming that criticism is not taken as interventionism itself., @reason " Nothing you can do to his statues will alter history so that Robert E. Lee never existed."\n\nActual history ?  That is true.\n\nReported and written history is another story altogether - the people who write these can be altered, @reason "decides whom we are allowed to buy from and sell to"\n\nA violation of Freedom of Association  - something @reason seldom supports even though it addresses  almost all human interaction regardless of market associations or personal ones., @MyoclonicJerk42 @reason And like I said before,  they have to state-mandated plan or authoritarian plan as what you want supported by state theft that you support, @reason "The only antidote is to assert authority and take responsibility for doing the right thing."\n\n?\n\nThat is precisely what politicians always do, @reason "Trump's Coronavirus Response Has Saved Over 2 Million Lives'\nThat claim is wildly implausible and contradicted by the president's suggestion that COVID-19 was never much of a threat."\n\n2 different subjects ENTIRELY\n@reason is either ignorant or purposefully misstating the facts., @reason "Some libertarian policy experts are divided on the subject of aid to restaurants and other small businesses affected by government shutdowns."\n\nThe above may call themselves libertarian for supporting state welfare, but the idea they are experts is garbage, @ENBrown @reason Punishment for motive of a crime should be on a different level than determining the crime itself !\nOtherwise the jury's conclusion can become biased.\n\nModifying punishment based upon circumstances sounds like something that should be carried out by the judge - not the jury., @reason "their entire purpose was to re-enshrine the idea that accused students and professors should not be presumed guilty from the outset of a complaint. "\n\n"should" does not mean "must", @Younguns4Texit @reason letters that challenge freedom of association by demeaning some associations as not worth concern for those  supporting liberty is a problem - whether action has been taken yet or not., @reason "A year into the pandemic, politicians still have not digested the dangers of careless public health measures."\n\nWhat makes @reason think that is a major issue for politicians ?\nBecause they haven't done what @reason says is correct ?, @reason Unlike typical articles on immigration by @reason , this one restricts itself to "earned immigration" .\n\n@reason 's typical bootstrapping for illegal immigration was / is not warranted except for their political support of a "right to immigrate " even when illegal.., @reason Not even many libertarians recognize that the state is a COERCIVE monopoly.\nUntil these libertarians agree to stop supporting coercion, then the storyline presented seems unlikely., @reason "It's wrong for politicians to suppress important debates in schools. "\n\nWhile that may be true, that possibility / power  was always here from the beginning of public schools., @reason Legalization for state-defined recreational users and sold my state-licensed store !!\n\nI bet @reason doesn't even bother to call it limited, @reason @reason has yet to provide any detailed explanation of violation of rights in it opposition to AI technology  - not to mention @reason 's  support for banning it in some circles.\n\nApart from some general words like "surveillance" and "privacy" , it has said little to nothing,, @reason I  think it is disappointing that the increase in politicization of so many things over recent years by the state / politicians was not mentioned  as a contributing factor.\n\nSimilar timelines ?, @reason "1 percent of the electorate who dependably vote Libertarian are neither latent Republicans nor closet Democrats but, well, libertarians"\n\nWelch's decision to equate voters for the LP as libertarians shows his REPUBLOCRAT political thinking, @reason I find the logic here to distinguish cigarettes from so-called premium cigars extremely unconvincing., @reason "Libertarian Shane Hazel Is Proud To Be a Spoiler in Georgia Senate Race"\n\nWhat is interesting is seeing all those republicans claiming a similarity with libertarians all of a sudden making the LP their enemy., @reason @LPNational @Jorgensen4POTUS "I think we should support the protesters, but, at the same time, get rid of the opportunistic people hijacking the movement." \n\nI agree with the above distinction for the most part. Conservatives have historically blamed the movement (or people) rather than those exploiting it, @petersuderman @reason @bonniekristian "Vision of Religious Liberty"\n\nDespite what the constitution says, the actual right is freedom of belief - not freedom of religious belief\n\n@reason 's apparent decision to treat religion separately is an actual danger to our freedom, @reason "would require stores to have one unisex section for children's products"\n\nActually I think that would qualify as a violation of freedom of expression to dictate how others display their products, @SShackford @reason "This ruling significantly broadens how courts will analyze what sex discrimination means. "\n\nDoes it apply to home/hetero sexuals who discriminated against whom they dated or married based upon their sex ?, @catoletters @reason "While Facebook is within its rights to take action against content it believes is factually misleading"\n\nWhile that may be true, it is extremely arrogant of Facebook to enforce its belief of the truth on its clientele, @reason "Blackface incident at Post cartoonist's 2018 Halloween party resurfaces amid protests."\n\nDid the Post oppose white-face incidents where blacks paint their face white ?\nOr is this a discriminatory  and racist policy ?, @cgomez000 @reason It's always been extortion - simply not as bold as today's political environment allows., @reason "Check Your Authoritarian Blind Spot"\n\nAnd that most likely are the authorities in the groups you support., @reason "The only thing worse than being subjected to arbitrary, intrusive rules imposed to fight a pandemic is when those same rules fail to accomplish their goals"\n\nThat is debatable as the claim can be made truthfully that the intrusive rules worked, @jimepstein @reason @FreeToChooseNet Despite  its left-wing bias, PBS was certainly not a member of the cancer culture in those days.\n\nTheMcNeil Lehrer News Hour was the first news station I heard give political acceptability to the term "libertarianism", @Uncle_Tuna @reason Not sure the article claimed Wallace was objective so much as somewhat unbiased.\n\nBut he certainly doesn't kiss social liberal a** as many do., @reason Isn't this a good explanation of republican behavior through the years ! ?, @reason " White House to allow private companies to beam internet service into Cuba "\n\nA low-level foreign intervention if White House does more than simply allow, @hooliegirls @reason While I don't necessarily agree with your interpretation, I do think Gillespie made a mistake to include his personal stance with his political one., @reason "We Don't Need New Domestic Terrorism Laws"\n\nI am inclined to believe that view traces back to Trump's threat about Antifa and not any general principle they have.., @Fluffernightma1 @reason Many states prohibit criminals in jail from voting, @cameraman502 @reason But you expect them to use that principle based upp0n your own beliefs that conservatives do the same !, @reason If anyone looks like a mobster , it is the Illinois governor, @brianmdoherty "Wait, Wasn't Peter Thiel a Libertarian?..."\n\nSimply because he said he was once in awhile ?\nOr did @reason promote him as one too at one time ?, @reason Unfortunately the article treats the concept of tolerance as if is something that occurs in a vacuum with no need of explanation.\n\nFor instance, should we tolerate murder, rape , and theft ?\n\nTucille provides no clue at all as to what it takes to be tolerant., @DogDaddy4Life @reason There is no mandate for the state to handout the dearth penalty - as the article mentions, @reason The simple fact is that @reason doesn't know who is an actual immigrant or not for the most part. They are illegal border crossers..\n\nCalling them immigrants is simply to promote @reason 's pro-immigration policies., @LuciusCincinna7 @reason And I call people claiming involuntary servitude to the state is simply contributing to society as extremely authoritarian  - not to mention an opponent of the  liberal concept of Freedom of Association., @reason State-mandated diversity with regard to race relies on a pre-defined concept of the races to be considered.\nThat such as idea may ultimately result here is not implausible., @ENBrown @reason The republican party has acted as if it could care less about converting people for years., @reason @MattWelch IMHO, Reason needs to return to writing some articles on libertarian ideology and internal disagreements rather than simply applying them to contemporary issues., @HighestHorseman @bob_falls_down @ENBrown @reason They may have different code but they are NOT distinct entities - only distinct things of that entity.\nThey are connected and presumably dependent \n\nHowever, a person has private property in one's body and therefore the right to manage and control it - or claim it is not property, @reason If we start with the assumption that it is "equal protection under the law" that requires  that the state allow gay marriage . then we must also reject the restriction of 2 people only also.\n\nThis means libertarians should support legalizing polygamy also., The crisis at the border is about illegal border crossings - not just immigration as @reason likes to claim.\n\nBut @reason has a policy of pro-immigration which is politically better suited by its characterization as  an immigration issue .\n\nDraw you own conclusions., @reason "editors -- Trump, Biden, the RNC, the DNC, --"\n\nWhy were the LPC and Jorgensen excluded ?, @reason "and states and localities can set their own minimum wages. "\n\nSuch statements by @reason shows they lack libertarian principles  when it comes to state-mandated wages., @billybinion @reason "Charge them for their crimes, not their thoughts."\n\nThis would be contradictory to the concepts of 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree murder which in many cases is dependent on motive / belief.\n\nThe real question is whether charging for the belief is a part of an actual criminal action or not, @reason "The residence restrictions, on the other hand, really ought to be opposed on the grounds that they are an odious infringement on personal liberty."\n\nAs opposed to non-odious infringements which @reason implies did not have to be opposed ?, @reason using taxes to help people is absurd.\n\nReal help might come as a tax cut instead, @nickgillespie @reason @AjitPaiFCC If @reason thinks it is only a re-statement of our right to communications, then it should say so rather than treating it as a special circumstance., @8bitSerge @Jerrod1776 @reason Because you and Biden both support a coercive m0onpoly state  - just as state socialists do, @reason Equal protection under the law should apply to all laws - including marriage\n\nPeople who wished that marriage would still be a religious concept under the state should have opposed the state takeover, @corey_vollinger @reason Maybe everyone should be injected with DNA that makes them grey rather than black or white., @tomfooleryatlaw @reason "The University of Oklahoma is not considered a private institution."\n\nWas that stated in the article at all ?\nThe whole idea of a possible violation of freedom of speech rests on that issue, @reason "Let's replace the names of Confederate figures ---"\n\nThis reads more like @reason trying to exploit (validate ?) recent events to support something it believes in, @reason @petersuderman "One thing that's more clear than ever after a year of pandemic governance is that politicians and policymakers know less than they think they do,"\n\nOr what they know is far less relevant to their policy decisions - such as their seeming relevant, @LuciusCincinna7 @reason except for punishment !\n\nDo you consider the draft a form, of punishment for a crime  ?\nPerson must be convicted too., @ENBrown @reason "Republican Gov. Kristi Noem told CBS's Face the Nation that she's urging state lawmakers to keep people from being prescribed abortion pills through remote appointments with out-of-state doctors."\n\nThat would seem to be active even if the woman in question is not even pregnant !, The above includes the top editors at @reason who cheer the concept of limited coercion., @bobkasamakas @reason I agree with the above assuming there actually is a reason., @reason “The idea that refugees are a uniquely dangerous national security threat –”\n\n“vetting on would-be immigrants”\n\nSo is @reason talking about refugees or would-be refugees ?, @reason "Second, the Supreme Court has defined commercial speech as expression that does "no more than propose a commercial transaction."  "\n\nThe above is why freedom 0f speech is a right to begin with and why it should cover speech as opposed to freedom of non-commercial speech, @reason @MattWelch If @MattWelch supports open borders, he supports a policy that is dependent on a state-controlled society with public property for border crossers to use.\n\nIn a society of private property, open borders would violate property rights., @JeffNasse1 @reason One shouldn't have to insert "for adults only" when talking about rights, @reason I find it interesting that the article writer not once mentions illegal immigration unless in a quote by others.\n\nOne could almost guess that this is intentional \nHowever failing to note that  comes irresponsibly close to misinformation for an article that is basically about that, @reason "Mitt Romney's Family Plan Isn't Great, but It May Be Better Than the Alternatives"\n\nIf that is supposed to be an argument for support, it fails !, @8bitSerge @Jerrod1776 @reason Awwwww  have to swear already to prove your aright ?\nYou are probably a fascist Biden supporter, What we do not hear from @reason is their justification for section 230 that provides special protections when it comes to freedom of communication that is not provided for ordinary citizens.\n\nThe truth is that libel laws based upon the property right to ones reputation is false, Immigration is both a foreign policy and a domestic one.\n\n@Reason ''s support for special immigration laws aimed at Chine and  and Hong Kong for their internal policies and problems constitutes foreign interventionism, @MyoclonicJerk42 @reason You never said whether you supported theft ?\n\nI have to assume you do since you were afraid to answer\n\nAnd state theft at that - which you would not allow citizens to do.\nBut your love of the state shows. Wo9uld you support state murder too ?, @reason @reason 's failure to even bring the subject up is very disappointing !, @Lex_Jurgen @reason My guess is that people do not want to elect persons who seem devoted to other politicians and come across as nothing more than FOLLOWERS, @reason Relatively short, to the point, and well written by Soave., @reason Adjust according to state-mandate, of course - not a private / personal schedule., @tomfooleryatlaw @reason That is a court decision that while it may involve state-funded educational institutions, it  actually has no statement about the importance of that concept to the actual decision.\n\nIt also seems to appeal to authority by simply citing the past court decisions as a proof., @reason "But the justices have a duty to uphold the law,"\n\nAbsolutely not - particularly if the law in place in unconstitutional\nThe above statement seems to imply there is not even a use for judges other than rubber-stamping the law., @SluggoMcguffin @reason What the state has or has not done in the past is not a rationale for passing restrictions on the freedom of association between people, @reason "“Would vaccine vigilantes be justified in stealing and distributing AstraZeneca doses locked up by order of the government?”\n\nI didn’t know stealing could be justified !\n\nPoor statement by Britschgi, @CProtopapas @reason I'm addicted to the concept of freedom of association - including freedom of  economic associations that free markets are based upon.\n\nI assume you support state-mandated associations instead, @8bitSerge @Jerrod1776 @reason People have a right to rent their property - including their labor in which case the rent is called a wage., @dmountjr @reason Not to mention that people committing suicide but with the virus are counted as COVID deaths, @reason @gfriedma @sallypipes @TheSohoForum Medicare-for-all is an attempt by the state to create a coercive monopoly in the healthcare industry - except controlled by the state.\n\nMost of these plans would prohibit private healthcare., @reason Or he supports school choice as a means to get higher teacher pay than all other states., @HighestHorseman @bob_falls_down @ENBrown @reason You can if they refuse to leave \n\nOr the trespass may be by an object in which case you may remove it anytime you please, @reason "Young activists are often hostile to members of the media, particularly if they perceive journalists as not explicitly on their side. That's a regrettable habit. Ironically, it's something they have in common with the cops."\n\nNeither of which is an excuse for violent action., @reason "it's the height of frustration to be governed by idiots."\n\nWell, maybe by idiots is better than people who purposefully lie to you :)\n\nOr so we are told ?, @reason @kennymxu @ProfDBernstein Affirmative action can only really be affirmative if the person doing it affirms it., @reason "Instead of fiercely condemning China’s oppressive government,---"\n\nWhile that may be OK for foreign policy, OFFICIAL condemnation of domestic policy of a country borders on foreign interventionism that could easily expand - not that @reason cares. Hong Kong is now part of China., @reason @oren_cass @scottlincicome @TheSohoForum "Should the U.S. Government Adopt an Industrial Policy? "\n\nYes, it's called laissez faire, @reason "The already-battered cruise ship industry is now caught between conflicting federal and state rules in Florida."\n\nAuthoritarian state-mandated laws of association are frequently in conflict with one another, @reason We can only hope that 20,000 "immigrants" dressed in Russian military uniforms do not cross the border illegally as Reason may want to let them in under open borders.\n\nThey could just be looking for asylum under Reason logic., @reason "will endanger the lives of those performing the executions "\n\nI wonder what the judge would say about hospital staff that have to treat those with COVID ?, @reason " will people still choose to flock to cities?

More work to be done, but we’ve already significantly increased testing availability since this time last year, and it will be further increased in the weeks ahead. https://t.co/LSC25i7Tlk, .@POTUS is delivering remarks on how we’ve achieved the largest one-year drop in the deficit in American history while building an economy where everyone does well. https://t.co/ZKo3bNHLa6, more from my full comment: @POTUS  is president for all Americans no matter who they voted for. And so our focus is on continuing to plug away on pushing for policies that will help everyone and through that work we can rebuild trust in government. That government can work. https://t.co/fkmxmxOCJa, @Rashtrakut @POTUS You are right! Not enough coffee this am, Last night, @POTUS declared an emergency for Florida, mobilizing Federal assistance even before the storm makes landfall.\n \nFEMA also proactively pre-positioned supplies across the region.\n\nWe are ready to support the people of Florida. https://t.co/Mj00xHZtzm, "We need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines, and if we can't ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21." - @POTUS, Thanking some incredible volunteers at the Houston Food Bank @POTUS @FLOTUS https://t.co/Dg4heEdzWM, I’ve gotten a ton of great questions on Twitter since our last video, so I took some time to answer a few more here. We covered a lot of ground -- from what we are doing on vaccines, to how @POTUS is helping small businesses, to an update on Major and Champ. https://t.co/X9P48csp9S, .@POTUS: "I will do everything within my power to protect Dreamers, but Congressional Republicans should stop blocking a bill that provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers." https://t.co/coxyVuUGjx, @POTUS made clear that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would act with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 does not move forward. We have been in close consultations with Germany overnight and welcome their announcement. We will be following up with our own measures today., .@POTUS has been briefed about the developing hostage situation in the Dallas area. He will continue to receive updates from his senior team as the situation develops.  Senior members of the national security team are also in touch with federal law enforcement leadership., While @POTUS and @VP are focused today on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and lowering costs for the American people, Republicans in Congress are focused on stripping away rights from millions of American women. https://t.co/qCRuY0JE8e, I know facts are uncomfortable to some, but just ask leading retailers, the mayors of port towns, and port operators, and they’ll tell you the same thing: @POTUS was a key player in getting this done and easing supply chain burdens:\nhttps://t.co/LjvukKTjqt https://t.co/bmwPJxkarS, I will wait here for the apparent growing chorus referenced here who are opposed (that is right opposed according to this tweet) to a @POTUS who honors the lives of those lost, with empathy and grace. https://t.co/MrhLyIAAHa, It’s clear that @POTUS’s economic plan is working: new unemployment claims last week fell to their lowest levels in 16 months.\n\n@business: “Jobless Claims Fall to Pandemic Low, Underscoring U.S. Rebound” \n\nhttps://t.co/zmK4Tzd63P, This report on cyber options being presented to @POTUS is off base and does not reflect what is actually being discussed in any shape or form., .@POTUS talking about the importance of Medicare and Social Security: “There’s the new retiree in Aurora… In the past few years, he's been dealing with diabetes, heart disease…without Social Security and Medicare, it would be impossible for him to afford the care he needs.”, @POTUS has been briefed on the latest developments regarding the New York City subway shooting. White House senior staff are in touch with Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Sewell to offer any assistance as needed., .@POTUS promised to build an economy that finally works for working families. The Inflation Reduction Act does just that lowering costs for families, combating the climate crisis, reducing the deficit, and finally asking the largest corporations to pay their fair share., Today, @POTUS will highlight how he and Congressional Democrats will continue to fight to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, contrasting with Congressional Republicans who want to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. https://t.co/f15AYcqlfz, The @Bengals aren't the only ones winning this week...During the last administration, manufacturing jobs were lost. Under @POTUS’s leadership they are coming back. Today, @Intel announced a new $20 billion semiconductor plant in Columbus, creating thousands of manufacturing jobs. https://t.co/9nuVbuZwsZ, @POTUS will host a bipartisan meeting of the leaderships from each chamber @WhiteHouse on May 12. He is eager to talk in-person about how we can partner on the goals of restoring trust in government and ensuring that government delivers for the American people., .@POTUS “And folks [Republicans in Congress] are also coming for your Social Security and Medicare.”, Lets be clear: @potus was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election. He was making the opposite point: In 2020, a record number of voters turned out in the face of a pandemic, and election officials made sure they could vote and have those votes counted., .@POTUS and his Administration stand with LGBTQI+ students everywhere, including in Florida where they have passed hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students. https://t.co/WAB2Ksdbqf, This is wildly out of step with where the American people are. @POTUS is focused on expanding rights and delivering for all Americans, not taking us back., The American people overwhelmingly back @POTUS's student loan forgiveness decision - which includes an income cap.\n\nNearly 90% goes to Americans making under $75,000.\n\nAmericans earning under $75,000 would be shocked to hear their governors call them "elite."\n\nSo out of touch. https://t.co/Ll34FhJgVQ, thanks @davidaxelrod for the walk down memory lane, fun convo about the changing media dynamics, Twitter, what I have learned from working for and watching @potus and @BarackObama and @JohnKerry about politics, governing, media and life https://t.co/LgDj5mZaJb, .@potus looks forward to attending the Senate Dem Caucus lunch today to continue making the case for the duel track approach to build the economy back better by investing in infrastructure, protecting our climate, and supporting the next generation of workers and families., .@POTUS: “Just in the Hudson Valley IBM is investing $20 Billion.”, .@POTUS  “As President, I will not accept an argument that says our problem is that too many Americans are finding good jobs…Or that too many working people finally have dignity in the workplace...

Sadly I’m still Covid-positive, and remote voting isn’t allowed, but I’ll be glued to the screen. https://t.co/FGDqEkHsg4, @UKHouseofLords needs to be careful before repeatedly defying the Commons - but a compelling substantive and procedural case has been made for this new and modest amendment, which would impose a standstill on passing on costs until the long-awaited statutory scheme is in force., Pulsating debate in @UKHouseofLords this afternoon on citizenship deprivation - with and without notice. See Hansard report https://t.co/9XIrRtkkoA and video from 15:44-18:18 (I was on just after 4pm) https://t.co/MDJiue8wQo.

A more dispassionate and accurate approach will be needed in our @UKHouseofLords debates on this clause and on #NBBill generally. /2, @OborneTweets @UKHouseofLords @RishiSunak The bill is still to have its second reading, to be fair – I’m trying to find out from whips’ office when this is likely to be., @JackGavigan Two significant amendments now made however by @UKHouseofLords - we’ll see where the Bill goes from here., The wealth of relevant experience in @UKHouseofLords and its value as a scrutinising Chamber were on display at Tuesday’s #PCSCBill 2nd reading https://t.co/SYMxzQXDfH. Some 12 days of detailed debates and votes will follow. Government and @HouseofCommons would do well to listen., NB In none of these cases did @UKHouseofLords outfight the @HouseofCommons: in any trial of strength, the elected House quite properly wins in the end. /9, However it has a rival in the form of #NIPBill, which comes to @UKHouseofLords on 11 Oct with the additional spice of remarkable disregard for our international obligations. /3, “We are eating the elephant in chunks”: repeated hints from the Minister in ⁦@UKHouseofLords⁩ today that the manifesto-pledged “Constitution, Democracy and Human Rights Commission” will never be convened. https://t.co/8Yip8mHEfp, Wow.

We will come back to some issues, notably the strange little "presumption in favour of the wrongdoer" ((c) Lord Judge) at report (voting) stage., @redhistorian @UKHouseofLords Particularly when the PM is unconvinced of their value – as alleged in today’s @thetimes by @SirJJQC: https://t.co/puRHFmQcca https://t.co/rfqm0dRuiE, Complete transcript of yesterday’s #EnvironmentBill is here https://t.co/MQIMf2IqCN - or view the speeches of Lords Rooker (18:10) and Duncan of Springbank (20:12) for a masterclass in @UKHouseofLords speaking https://t.co/P2xxdOOXKd https://t.co/CmPkDE2FBZ, @Pythika @TomTugendhat @UKHouseofLords I look forward very much to listening once I have heard more from the red benches., We pushed hard in @UKHouseofLords last year for meaningful amendment on the issue of sewage discharges (also OEP independence and remedies - all cross-bench amendments). We ping-ponged hard but finally had to accept what the elected House would give us: https://t.co/Td5vDSU1z2, Fair to point out though that some small (if inadequate) scraps of comfort were tossed to @UKHouseofLords yesterday (see under clause 15 https://t.co/p7wdpA6tPr). The revised clauses will appear in the Elections Act 2022 once published., Lord Robathan’s fatal motion rejected 376-30. Remainder not moved.

Will this be inserted during the passage of the Bill? @UKHouseofLords will not be amused if it comes too late for effective scrutiny. /5, The Northern Ireland (Troubles) Reconciliation Bill has just been published: https://t.co/s8yKiUc3e4. The subject-matter is intractable but I look forward to engaging with it when it comes to @UKHouseofLords., Thanks to the students at St John &amp;amp; St James Primary, Enfield, and @Alleyns_School for the welcome via @UKParlEducation this morning.

There is much to thank him for - to give one example,his role in securing the offence of non-fatal strangulation. Government will miss him sorely: I hope he remains active on the back benches in @UKHouseofLords. https://t.co/CQfomk8agS, My short tribute to Her Majesty in @UKHouseofLords this afternoon (from 1455): https://t.co/8T2CeyLjjr /1 https://t.co/qWuFTcPXcO, Something to bear in mind as we debate the proposed additions in @UKHouseofLords tonight https://t.co/N3mlX8o0lG, @JoshuaRozenberg @AMcCQC It is from the fact that you are first and foremost barrister and reporter, not campaigners, that your interventions derive their power. Long may that continue. We must try to get a @UKHouseofLords debate on the finished Ouseley report (if not classified as secret 😉)., In her excellent foreword Meg Russell of @ConUnit_UCL, noting Canada's progress towards a Senate of cross-benchers https://t.co/vfxjHIRNb5, describes @UKHouseofLords as "oddly modish" (I'll take that). /3, @Dowellenough @UKHouseofLords Thanks Julien, I hadn’t seen that., @SirJJQC @UKHouseofLords Link https://t.co/GU3c4G8qwr, @OborneTweets @UKHouseofLords @RishiSunak I didn’t get a reply, but Labour seem well-disposed (see this tweet from @AngelaRayner who leads on these issues). Will the Tories really surrender the moral high ground on this? https://t.co/lqQwTHSwD3, Government response to the critical @humanrightsctte  report on #CHISBill was published at 11am- just in time for today’s @UKHouseofLords debate https://t.co/3uY1Xg1uwJ, @JOgilvieHarris @UKHouseofLords We last tried this in 2015 and the Commons, I think, in 1979. Like other nuclear options, it risks massive retaliation: https://t.co/OTvnBHJLeO. The more radical and more feasible option is to remove improper rule-making powers from Bills, as Lisvane suggested., The omission of war crimes is not just a detail - it rips the heart out of the Robertson amendment that was so convincingly adopted https://t.co/fGPO8mVWl3 in @UKHouseofLords /4, @NWOGaction @UKHouseofLords See clause 2 - PM chooses from a shortlist of appointable candidates arrived at by a majority-independent assessment panel, as provided by the governance code for major public appointments https://t.co/quYQb82GtM., Nice shout-out by @BaronessDeech for @akulith in the @UKHouseofLords debate (now being broadcast on BBC Parliament). Lord Pannick is on in 10 minutes., President Biden politely damned in @UKHouseofLords by  @PhilipHammondUK, former UK Defence and Foreign Secretary, for “political tidy-mindedness”., Useful piece by ⁦⁦@AlexHorne⁩ for ⁦@UKandEU⁩ on recent advances in ⁦@UKHouseofLords⁩ Treaty scrutiny mechanisms - including the new “Grimstone Rule” (or Convention) https://t.co/NKdeFUwirM https://t.co/r45kZhITPa, More on this no doubt, and on the Bills just published or announced, in @UKHouseofLords debate on Queen’s Speech (justice, constitution, home affairs), from 11am today https://t.co/iESaqHiUXa. https://t.co/AX8sQbofTV, We passed @DavidAltonHL’s revised amendment in @UKHouseofLords this week by 359-188. With separation of powers concerns now addressed, I hope it succeeds on Tuesday in @HouseofCommons, where the previous version lost by only 11 votes. @politicshome @aarif_abraham @AppgUyghurs https://t.co/fNp5lQIUlh, @ShaistaGohir @UKHouseofLords Welcome to the crossbenches! There’s plenty to do there, and your new colleagues look forward very much to working with you., This Bill can expect wide support in @UKHouseofLords: I look forward to a chance to debate it. https://t.co/SwFyxpKFMU, All this needs debating, which I hope we will achieve in @UKHouseofLords committee on 27 January, with a vote if necessary to follow some weeks later at report stage., Furore over HMG public order defeats should not distract from other important changes to #PCSCBill made by @UKHouseofLords last night: urgent review into spiking and injections,making misogyny an aggravating factor in sentencing many crimes (as a racial element already is) … /1, It sounds from the Minister's winding speech that the Government will definitely reconsider on this. A good example of @UKHouseofLords soft power (or influence). Quite how far HMG is prepared to go, we shall have to see., “Irredeemable and unfixable”: depressing appraisal by @CAJNi of the NI (Troubles) Bill, which @UKHouseofLords debates next month. Politics being the art of the possible, I remain open to amendments that could render the Bill genuinely ECHR-compliant. https://t.co/5N8H97xZtU https://t.co/haUHL1xl9R, Debate in @UKHouseofLords on #NBBill is here (still going). Some strong voices of experience, including ex-Home Secretaries David Blunkett and John Reid https://t.co/aSZOOWNg2r, @Dowellenough @JoshuaRozenberg @AMcCQC @UKHouseofLords Don’t despair. As @ComplainingMon1 says there are shades of opinion within govt; the SIAs know they rely on public trust; barristers work pro bono; courts (and @UKHouseofLords) have strong views about when a court process is fair; and tough talk may be only that - see JR reform., We need "the right figures, the right data, and proper information": Theresa May furious on the entry into lockdown. https://t.co/eTPKnHCuE6 @UKHouseofLords debates this from 5pm., Persuasion and persistence in @UKHouseofLords  got results in the Immigration and Agriculture Bills today. Now the gloves come off for Part 5 of the #IMBill: watch live here https://t.co/kgqcTbTfSj https://t.co/iQzerMLQ0P, Lord Frost now being quizzed in @UKHouseofLords on UK-EU matters https://t.co/cLJnURrm44, I totally agree and am about to table a Public Service (Integrity and Ethics) Bill in @UKHouseofLords which would tackle these defects and also put the Public Appointments Commissioner snd ACOBA on a statutory footing as recommended by @PublicStandards. https://t.co/8KVS1R5JSh, Great to see that opinion favours a continuation in some form  of the virtual ⁦@UKHouseofLords⁩ - even if not all peers share the views I expressed here: https://t.co/CF3ngXT0W2 https://t.co/iDGe0GSSow, @mikarv @UKHouseofLords The amazing thing is how well it works, in a House with median age of 71. These things do not happen without intensive cooperation, and it mostly happened on Zoom and WhatsApp. Think what we could do in a few years time, with better technology and a more digital skilled House!, Some would have preferred to remove clause 9 altogether - but given the national security reasons advanced for it (and the flat rejection of numerous other @UKHouseofLords amendments), that was never going to be accepted by the Govt or the elected House. /2, ...]</td>

Would have loved to have been good enough writer to do something similar! But such interesting and unfortunately perennial issues identified and highlighted!, @tanzania8 @UofGEducation @mr_cstewart @InesAlves @catlaughing @Susie13Marshall @GioFassetta @plynch115 Great to have aspiring head teachers whose aim is to create inclusive environments! And to have been part of the journey! Sorry not to be teaching L and C any more!! Well done @mr_cstewart!, @tanzania8 @UofGEducation Will be helpful - we have been talking about impact of IDL in primary and sec contexts - this is interesting, Need to read the detail of this @tanzania8 @InesAlves @Susie13Marshall @queraltcm @UofGEducation https://t.co/rhZ6KUT1DP, @tanzania8 @Eavanmac @UofG_Alumni @InesAlves @catlaughing Excellent - and what a great role model for the students!, @tanzania8 @UofGEducation Certainly is - makes the hard work worthwhile when you hear that the book is fulfilling its purpose! We really want student teachers to think hard about important things @juliemca @drmo28 @MScMuseumEd @Margery25 @WingraveMary, @realdcameron @craig_carol @UpstartScot @scepticalscot @JohnCarnochan @mannajon @tanzania8 I could almost have accepted ‘how many weeks are in a month’ but spend a lot of time trying to help teachers and student teachers recognise that often the question is the cause of confusion and ‘wrong’ answers, @tanzania8 @UofGEducation @Susie13Marshall @InesAlves @GlasgowAlumni Great to hear this - can you capture for ‘impact’?!, @tanzania8 @Susie13Marshall @InesAlves @Eavanmac Indeed - as most of the replies point out this is (a) not a surprise to those working in schools and (b) a predictable outcome of policies over the past 30 years ...!!, @tanzania8 @InesAlves https://t.co/ylpIoAUsNi, @ElliePrimary1 @pedagoo Can’t beat the old ‘Foundations of writing’ approach! Covers so much important stuff including body awareness!  Lovely to see this! @tanzania8, @tanzania8 @Susie13Marshall @Eavanmac @ChrisOrr_ELC @GilchristGeorge oh my goodness ..., @tanzania8 @InesAlves @Susie13Marshall @GioFassetta @plynch115 @sarahan48512436 I have to start working on my list ...🤦‍♀️, You will probably have seen this @tanzania8 @InesAlves @Susie13Marshall - useful on our courses? and for other students/staff @UofGEducation https://t.co/CLqyoINFXl, @tanzania8 @Susie13Marshall Yes, looking forward to the new session!, @tanzania8 @StephenMcKinne8 I know - while issues are similar and important, this can be confusing for all ..., Delighted that a colleague has recognised what has been the aim of my work for the past 15 years! @UofGEducation @tanzania8 @InesAlves @Susie13Marshall @GeorgeHead5 @gtcs https://t.co/m8CYs3WctZ, @tanzania8 @InesAlves Hadn’t seen the website or the publication - will look at both and share, ...]</td>

      <td>[@The_Do_Good Gasp. \n\n     “As a Jedi yes. But he’s no scruffy nerf herder.”, @The_Do_Good And she’s catching the glass in her hand, then taking a sip. Not a bad job., @The_Do_Good She took a drag of her own cigarette at last. “Cat person? And I am. I was thirsty and didn’t want to drink the good stuff until you’d arrived. They’ve got scotch here that was barrelled during the war.”, @The_Do_Good [sms: Lazza]\n\nThank goodness. I’ve got a nice bottle of whiskey here., @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nMeet me at Selfridges., @The_Do_Good “Or nice about it like you were.” She takes another long drink, humming in the process. “How’s Deutschland?”, @The_Do_Good Well he was just silly for thinking that she would think any less of him. Everyone had skeletons in their closet. Some more than most., @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nTry vinegar for the stain. Forgot to say., @The_Do_Good very well went and died on him in his bloody arms because I needed drugs more than love. If it wasn’t for Daniel I’d be dead and we wouldn’t be discussing any of this! You always wanted to be a lawyer didn’t you?” She was crying by now. “I always wanted to be a pretty ballerina.», @The_Do_Good “I hope so. Though he may try to be all — well Daniel and figure you out from across the room. I can manage a good Sunday roast.” She has a sip of her latte. “Girl troubles?”, @The_Do_Good “We haven’t gotten drunk together in quite some time.” She said while fishing her cigarettes from her pocket., @The_Do_Good “Sounds good. I’ll be here. Just give a quick glance at some papers.” Matilda smiles softly up at him., @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nPretty sure you’re working constantly even if you’re ‘relaxing’, @The_Do_Good It was easy enough. A sheet laid over the so called mattress and an extra duvet was placed on top with two pillows for him. After that was her turn for a little cigarette break., @The_Do_Good “I’m actually quite curious.” She ordered herself a vanilla soft serve cone with a flake and a hot chocolate for Laszlo. “Does this mean I’d have to find a new best friend if you leave?”, @The_Do_Good Just to be sure and not make her new best friend worry — she sent a text to tell him she made it to work okay and on time., @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nIm sure Hannah would say the same, @The_Do_Good He should know by now that that probably won’t change., @The_Do_Good “I could ask him. Why are you curious about that?” She’s confused now as she gets up and gets her things., @The_Do_Good “Should be fine?. I can give you an extra pillow if you like. I only need one as is.” Hopefully said pictures weren’t utterly ruined., @The_Do_Good Clearly he was a terrible liar which made this all the more fun. “Is it easy to get you drunk? Or does it depend upon the drink? You know.... I don’t think I’ve been properly drunk since I stopped doing coke.” She shrugs and takes a big sip. », @The_Do_Good “I’ll do the full English. Or is that too breakfasty?”, @The_Do_Good “Well it’s too big for a bedroom! Or I guess it could be I don’t know.” She waves it off and continues up the stairs where the door swings open. There’s still boxes but there are books on shelves!, @The_Do_Good “Then perhaps you should take the opportunity to get it sorted out. Get on the same page and all that.”, @The_Do_Good “All I know about wine is it tastes good and being wine drunk is actually pretty fun.” She should’ve known more since her family home had a wine cellar but it wasn’t as if she wished to know much about it when focused on other things.\n\n“Just try not to spill on your shirt dear.”, @The_Do_Good “I can’t really help you there. I’d be furious rather than hiding whisky in my coffee.” She could tell and smell it ever so slightly., @The_Do_Good “I’ve asked several times to get a place together and he just comes back telling me that we won’t until he gets his citizenship. Sometimes I feel like it’s just an excuse.”, @The_Do_Good “You’re right. Doctors first. I mean , I’ve always wanted them but I don’t know how he feels about having another kids when his daughter Fern is all grown.” She sighs and runs her fingers through her hair., @The_Do_Good “Well I asked because the houses are all painted different bright-ish colours that’s all.” She spoke whilst digging in her handbag for her glasses., @The_Do_Good [ txt: Lazza ]\n\nSounds good! \n\nShe attaches the address once she looks it up along with the cafe name, @The_Do_Good This makes Matilda chuckle slightly. \n\n“I know a good pathologist if you happen to die from a heart attack due to the mess.”\n\nShe’s teasing of course., @The_Do_Good It was pretty adorable how he rambled on when she gave over her number. “Just don’t lose that. Normally I don’t answer weird numbers but I’ll make an exception.” However she chanted her head a bit. “Why doesn’t the owner like you?”, @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nHave you been in Germany?\n\nAlso yes please., @The_Do_Good “Shit.” She pulled out her phone and looked at the time. “I suppose I shouldn’t be slightly tipsy whilst discussing The Great Gatsby. Though gin would be fitting...”, @The_Do_Good “Family is a bit shit innit? You don’t really get to pick it until you’re far older.” She moved now to go smoke up top on the deck just by the door., @The_Do_Good “Sorry have you seen my mate Laszlo. All I see here is a Jedi Knight.”, @The_Do_Good “You know what I mean. He is my favourite and maybe that’s why I like Poe. Reminds me of Han.”, @The_Do_Good “Sounds as if you’re a bit up shits creek without a paddle then. You should talk to her about it though. She could turn out to be supportive.”, @The_Do_Good “True. But I’m a ballerina turned drug addict turned call girl and now I teach so that’s weird itself.”, @The_Do_Good “As long as you’re on the side of the rebellion we can leave out the fact that Rogue One is clearly the superior of the last what... twenty years?”, I do believe I owe @The_Do_Good lunch., @The_Do_Good “Oh those are good too. Just never get a dog or your black clothes will be ruined by hair.” She laughs picturing him basically wearing a fur coat., @The_Do_Good “Maybe save that for a little bit longer? Until I’m less freaked out anyway.” She gulped down the rest of her coffee. Probably the last one she’d have in a long while., @The_Do_Good She had books spilling out of boxes and in neat little stacks here there and well everywhere really…\n\n“You’ll have to sleep on the sofa. There’s no bed in the guest room yet.”, @The_Do_Good She never keeps track of time. Not very well anyway., @The_Do_Good “I still say Han.” She speaks with brows raised as she brings her glass to her lips again. “This whisky is delicious by the way.”, @The_Do_Good “At that rate you’re going to become an alcoholic.” She teased and continued on their way. “You saw Hannah? How is she? I haven’t spoken to her in ages.”, @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nYou always seem to be, @The_Do_Good She sat back down and pulled out a cigarette to light up., @The_Do_Good “Well I’m sure she loves you so that probably has something to do with it.”, @The_Do_Good Matilda sighed and just nodded. “Alright. Maybe I’ll just go pick something out myself and have it sent over then.”, @The_Do_Good Considering he was a virgin when they met —— she’s proud of him., @The_Do_Good “Go snag it while I get the drinks!”, @The_Do_Good “Thank you.” She takes it and let’s him lead her along., @The_Do_Good “Goodnight Lazza!” She calls from the top of the stairs where she’s trying to stand upright., @The_Do_Good “Bollocks. I was a call girl for — “ well she doesn’t really want to add the years up... “four bloody years. I’ve seen all sorts and being a *ahem* isn’t all that odd.”, @The_Do_Good “I know where everything is. Obsessive organised chaos.”  She grins at him., @The_Do_Good “More like walking really quickly through lots of people.” She stops and takes a deep breath before taking the hot chocolate off him. “Thank you.”, @The_Do_Good “Oh. Well I only buy the really good stuff.” She’s in the kitchen now getting a bottle from her supply which seemed to be in surplus since she hadn’t been able to drink any., @The_Do_Good She eyes him a moment. “How’s the love life?”, @The_Do_Good “I suppose we have to make breakfast quick don’t we? You’ve got to run home and shower and all that.”, @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nWorks for me I’ve class at noon, @The_Do_Good “I shall most likely be using it often. And you can call or text me as much as you like. I actually had a nice evening.”, @The_Do_Good “Anyway. Oh we’re here. You can look at whatever you’d like but I need a baby safe car and hopefully don’t lack in questions.”, @The_Do_Good “That’s a rather good point really. She is old enough to really not need me as a parent sort.”, @The_Do_Good Now she can’t help but laugh. “I suppose it was yes. But how the hell was I supposed to know then? Ah well. You want the wine I’ve got stocked up then?”, @The_Do_Good “How cliché of you.” She chuckles and picks up her menu. “Hmm what do you fancy?”, @The_Do_Good “True.” She chuckles and sips her coffee., @The_Do_Good “What can I say?” She began to move in front of him, matching his pace. “I’m like Pandora’s box.”, @The_Do_Good Fair point. Well she’s knocking on his front door now., @The_Do_Good Was he worried she’d leave the party with someone else? He was the one that invited her — plus she wasn’t really like that. However she did finish her wine and went to the bar to get another drink. Too bad there wasn’t whiskey. A couple blokes tried to chat her up but Matilda », @The_Do_Good She too drained hers and set the glass on the table. “I think it’s time we retire for the night.”, @The_Do_Good “Would you ever want to be one?” Now she was utterly curious. “I’d be a step mother if Daniel and I get married. That’s a rather daunting thought.”, @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nClearly not or I’d have plants of my own in the house., @The_Do_Good She’s already moved on to the little corner area that’s the so called kitchen for two glasses. “He does yes. Mostly though he stays at mine. It’s cosy here though.”, @The_Do_Good “Ouch. I stubbed my toe once on the corner of my bed frame. Hurt for days so I thought I broke the damn thing.”\n\nA few more twirls were had., @The_Do_Good “I’m merely trying to help is all.”\n\nShe retorted watching him as he rose up from where they sat., @The_Do_Good “Something Daniel left so it’s got to be good.” She spoke softly while pouring them each a glass in a delicate manner., @The_Do_Good She lifted a brow and looked from the Tower to him. “Something on your mind?”, @The_Do_Good “The coffee at the university is shit too. What’s with that? All these important places having crap coffee when everyone needs it to function.”\n\nIt was nice having a conversation with someone for a change rather than be ignored or spoken over., @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nWorks for me. Now comes the bit where I say I prefer to get it from one of the trucks at the Tower of London and sit on the steps gazing at history whilst fighting off pigeons., @The_Do_Good “Just curious is all. Plus you’re not really the sort to have anything outlandish outside of your light saber. At least that’s what I think.”, @The_Do_Good Alright she’d back off with those sort of comments. It was just sort of part of her personality to be as such. Perhaps it was all things learned from her past life. The one between the ballerina and this one. “Usually I’d ask to join but I’ll let you have some air. I shall do », @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nWant to just meet at the coffee shop? I have to look up the nearest dealership., @The_Do_Good For being a shitty friend?, @The_Do_Good “Well naturally. But that could be a big opportunity if it happens to fall in your lap.”, @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nYou evidently are., @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nWow. A man that’s buying flowers without reasoning behind them. I am amazed. What’s her favourite colour?, @The_Do_Good She blinked a few times. “I may have stitched a few covers and bindings back together before.”, @The_Do_Good “I probably won’t show for a while but I suppose I have to tell them sooner rather than later. I’d rather have my first proper scan done before telling them. I can already picture the judgement on Mother’s face.”, @The_Do_Good Another drag is had. “Exactly why I should put in an ad for a housemate.”, @The_Do_Good [txt Lazza]\n\nHow are you with boats?, @The_Do_Good It wasn’t as if they had much of a choice. It was the only thing available and beat standing at the bar having drinks and trying to talk over people ordering. Soon enough she showed up with two glasses in hand. “This is the stuff that was distilled and barrelled during the war.”, @The_Do_Good [txt: Lazza]\n\nFine. You’re on., @The_Do_Good you.” She jokes and slips from being so close to him., @The_Do_Good “I’ll take somewhere in the middle then.” She took the coffee had had quite a large sip with her eyes closed just breathing it in., @The_Do_Good Another sip is had. It’s almost gone now. “Yes sadly. Oh there goes poor Dr. Jones did you know her fiancé left her and her baby died?!” She scoffs. “No thank you.”, @The_Do_Good “You try hauling boxes of books upstairs alone.” She put out her cigarette and downed her drink, setting the glass next to the ashtray on the coffee table. She then held her hand out for him. “Come on.”, @The_Do_Good She didn’t mean it like that. More so she was talking about herself. Either way she had another sip., @The_Do_Good “I could have slapped you if I really wanted to.” She manages to say with a soft chuckle. “At least it’s only an hour time difference.”, ...]</td>

      <td>[@LeneBruun Australia is run solely for the benefit of big business. Mining companies are rarely refused anything., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Me. Jacky wasn't on this trip unfortunately. It was after an African travel conference in Durban., @LeneBruun I often wonder what the boys and Paolo are thinking., @LeneBruun Hehe. You'd have all the hawkers running after you to. "Please sir. Come look my shop. Very cheap. Please slow down sir.", @PuppyaGuineaPig @LeneBruun Hehe. I'm not sure "sow stash" is strictly PC but basically you are correct., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun I agree Janet. Lie on the floor and eat cheesecake., @LeneBruun No, the coriander. My staff grow my basil for me., @LeneBruun Yup. If he wasn't he'd already be OTRB., @LeneBruun Good point. I'd rather be shot in the head than die alone and in agony on some cold street somewhere., @LeneBruun Would you like to borrow Paolo?, @LeneBruun Definitely my ears Lene. Billy's ears are perfect, or so he tells me, though you can barely see them through all that fur., @LeneBruun Mutual benefit. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Just like humans., @LeneBruun @BorisandGracie I think the wild bunny is preferable., @LeneBruun It's hard to know what is best sometimes. Tough to make decisions for another precious little person's life., @LeneBruun Add a case of wine and you can't lose., @LeneBruun @BorisandGracie She's having her angiogram today. In hospital tonight., @LeneBruun If I DM you my email address would you email the recipe? If it's a secret I'll understand. :o), @LeneBruun ....but if you don't register at the polling station you may get a fine., @LeneBruun @piggusbiggus Night Lene. Cuddle the twins for me., @LeneBruun So you and the twins will be sitting up all night watching?, @LeneBruun LOL!  Yes.\nhttp://t.co/deFA5V3As2, @LeneBruun Pretty island. I spent a month there in 84. Back then nobody would notice if you stuck a banana in each ear.   #1bigparty, @LeneBruun I must admit I've always found pictures of animals with human teeth a bit creepy., @LeneBruun That's good. Do you think you'll stay in touch with any of the people you've met there?, @LeneBruun You have to have shoes. Too cold in Denmark for bare feet. I have two pairs and running shoes. Lost count of how may Jacky has., @LeneBruun She wants you to be on heat Zakarias?, @LeneBruun Ah yes. Didn't know he was Danish. He makes a really good bad guy., @LeneBruun They do, but as Baci gets bigger its becoming a bit of a tight squeeze., @LeneBruun More like half an hour. I think he ate his alarm clock., @LeneBruun I'm still hoping that someone will invent something that makes guinea pigs live 100 years., @LeneBruun So, how was the birthday party?, @PuppyaGuineaPig @LeneBruun It's all good. Anyway we know what you're going through. Baci and Tom are still testosterone charged., @LeneBruun It's bad enough to be homeless here in Queensland, but in a cold place like Denmark. Just terrible., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Was worried about Baci this morning, but I think he might have been a little cold. Seems okay now., @LeneBruun Home again with an aching left arm. My mistake, it was hep A, not hep C. Still bloody hurts whatever it was., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Interesting combination. Did you ever see the UK comedy TV "The Vicar of Dibley"?, @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Have you read any of the "Ladies Number One Detective Agency" books by Alexander McCall-Smith?, @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Not a nice thought. Has your Mom passed away Janet? I can't remember if you told me or not., @clingycat @LeneBruun He'd like that. Probably has an inferiority complex - being white., @LeneBruun Hahaha. I think that's lovely Lene. Beautifully bonkers., @LeneBruun Not sure that's a good idea. You'd be like Jacky and I - never to able to sell any of them. Maybe just cages and food and stuff., @PuppyaGuineaPig @LeneBruun True. There are many worse thing to be called., @LeneBruun So you wouldn't go back. Tenerife is more interesting, @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Australia. Here http://t.co/2642HIQAH0, @LeneBruun Someone should have called the RSPCA. (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), @LeneBruun It is very interesting. We did a city tour yesterday afternoon. The Gandhi Museum was fascinating. Learned a lot about him., @LeneBruun You still need more guinea pig stuff., @LeneBruun I thought you might., @LeneBruun You are having a good night aren't you Lene. :o) See you in the morning., @LeneBruun Have fun Lene. Love to the twins. NO cheesecake for me at all today. Sunday is my only cheesecake day now., @LeneBruun I don't think he eats flesh. Maybe the zoo can lend you a vulture. ;o), @LeneBruun I'm sure it'll be summer...................somewhere., @LeneBruun There are a few mad guinea pig men out there too. Me for example............... I can't be the only one surely., @LeneBruun Some people think we're strange to love our guinea pigs so much. They'll never understand what they are missing., @LeneBruun Time for coffee. No cheesecake though. #diet, @PuppyaGuineaPig @LeneBruun Excellent advice Puppy.  There you go Zak. You too can be an international superstar and all round legend., @LeneBruun Good point. Maybe I should get her a chainsaw from Aldi instead., @LeneBruun @Earth_Pics Haha. What a wonderful photo. Thank you.  Did you find the sloth I tweeted to you yesterday?, @LeneBruun Actually that's exactly what it is.  Makes it hard to tell the girls from the boys. I have no idea why they have it though., @LeneBruun @LauraGrahamLG Probably the only way - if you can identify them., @LeneBruun Awww. Poor Zakarias. I bet he would., @LeneBruun Thanks me too. Nothing so far, just 32c and as humid as a guinea pigs arm pit. Had an almond croissant again today. Sleep well., @LeneBruun Haha. That sums them up rather well.  Interesting animals. Females are larger &amp;amp; stronger than males &amp;amp; have a false penis., @LeneBruun That's annoying. Pretend the punchbag is your pc., @LeneBruun Oh, so that's where it came from., @LeneBruun Shoes?, @LeneBruun Much better idea. It would really help to boost the tourist industry., @LeneBruun Thanks Lene and twins. Sleep well., @LeneBruun He he. He looks like he's just flown through a paint ball game., @LeneBruun Pretty good. Do you ever go to see local games?, @LeneBruun Vera? I don't know that one.  Where's it from?, @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun He's quite small too, so he chills quite quickly. He'd never survive in the wilds of Kentucky or Copenhagen., @JanisFelidae @LeneBruun Ah yes. That's the one. Thanks Janis. You're such a tech-savvy cat. Hopefully that'll help Lene. It helped did me., @LeneBruun Actually you're right, I should.  Haven't bought her flowers for a while., @LeneBruun Well, you know what they say. "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach." That applies to guinea pigs too., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Poor pup. Big changes for him. How's he getting along with Boris and Gracie?, @LeneBruun Why not? I do., @LeneBruun Please wish your Mom a very happy birthday from all of us., @LeneBruun You're right it does look pretty.  I must admit I was always glad when summer arrived though - if it ever it., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun Couldn't even make the funeral. Will help Dad distribute her ashes when he decides what to do with them., @LeneBruun Bye Lene. Have fun at boxing. Don't run too fast., @LeneBruun Billy doesn't seem to find it stressful at all., @LeneBruun Worth a try., @LeneBruun Same here. What are YSLs?, @LeneBruun No sure, but there were about 15 more behind them waiting to get out., @LeneBruun Hahaha. Maybe the new Star Wars movie will be about a race of honest alien politicians., @LeneBruun Is this your last boxing session?, @LeneBruun If that is the case CPH zoo should be ashamed of themselves. Animals are not training tools &amp;amp; should be shown more respect., @LeneBruun They usually get promoted here., @LeneBruun Maybe in my next life. Damn! I should have kept it., @LeneBruun @UberFacts Yes. Giraffe Manor.  I haven't stayed there but I have been to the sanctuary. You can feed the giraffes. It's lovely, @LeneBruun Yes Zakarias. No need for a sleeping bag, or even a pigloo., @LeneBruun I bet more people die from bad reactions to wasp and bee stings in Denmark than from snake bites in Australia., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun That's a skinny guinea. A breed of cavy. They seem to be becoming more popular. Not keen myself. Poor things., @BorisandGracie @LeneBruun There must be a more pleasant way to lose weight., @LeneBruun 2 biscotti and a skinny latte. Very nice, but not as good as cheescake., @LeneBruun You can promise it to get elected and then not deliver. They all do that don't they?, @LeneBruun That's okay Lene. As long as you're not running too far you won't do too much damage. I get sore calves if trainers are no good., @LeneBruun At least I got rid of the platform shoes and the lime green suit., @LeneBruun @BorisandGracie They must really hate the cold., ...]</td>

But returning to his Texas roots, he's been a big-time contributor in @BUFootball offense.\nhttps://t.co/KLGGydhxnQ, All the STAR position for @BUFootball has to do is blitz off the edge, defend the run and cover receivers one-on-one. Seems simple, right? @T_streets26 says @JayyPitree and @TheMcvea are a "perfect fit" and "making plays everywhere."\nhttps://t.co/0wdb7CJkO2, Defense for @BUFootball gets another stop at the end of 1st quarter. Sooners will be punting from their own 26 when we start the 2nd quarter here at AT&amp;amp;T Stadium in @Big12Conference Championship Game. OU leads, 10-0.#SicEm, After John Lovett does most of the heavy lifting, Charlie Brewer scores on a five-yard QB keeper, extending @BUFootball lead to 14-0 over UTSA. That was Charlie's eighth rushing TD of his career.#SicEm, Oklahoma puts together another long drive and goes back on top of @BUFootball 20-13 on 18-yard TD pass from Jalen Hurts to Nick Basquine. Safety JT Woods had good coverage, but never looked around. Bears have work to do with 18 minutes left in @Big12Conference Championship.#SicEm, Defense has given up 13 first-half points all year, including three in the first two Big 12 games. @BUFootball with another dominant first half, holding K-State to just 118 total yards, including 29 on the ground. Bears lead 10-3 at the halftime break.#SicEm, Holding serve, @BUFootball goes 54 yards in nine plays and scores on a 1-yard keeper by Charlie Brewer, his 84th career touchdown (63 pass, 21 rush), moving him to 2nd all-time behind only RG3. Bears trail @KStateFB 31-29 with 4:16 left.#SicEm, After a break following the Big 12 Championship game, @BUFootball went back to work in preparation for the New Year's Day Sugar Bowl game against @GeorgiaFootball. Matt Rhule said the Bears had "renewed energy." \nhttps://t.co/lX4Zu7fAeC, "Juice" Johnson, the @BUFootball running backs coach, found that not only can you go home again, you can also leave again. The former @UHCougarFB receiver and assistant coach says he has a "hungry group" of backs that are "ready to show what they can do."\nhttps://t.co/uSwby27lAf, After 32-yard pass to Denzel Mims, Charlie Brewer scores on 1-yard QB sneak to give @BUFootball a 27-20 lead in 1st overtime at McLane Stadium. Time for defense to close this thing.#SicEm, There goes that man again. Richard Reese picks up two first downs and 25 yards on five carries, then Blake Shapen hits Hal Presley for a nine-yard TD pass. @BUFootball goes up 24-3 early in the 3rd quarter.#SicEm, Really tough loss when you led by as many as 25, but I think this shows that @BUFootball belongs. Oklahoma guts out a 34-31 win in Waco by completely controlling things on offense in the 2nd half and just not giving the Bears any room. Two turnovers didn't help, either.#SicEm, That was pretty special. Grayland Arnold with a nifty 73-yard punt return to extend @BUFootball lead to 28-0 on UTSA. Blake Lynch and Tyquan Thornton with downfield blocks to get him into the end zone.#SicEm, Impressive series by @kyronDrones, who goes 3-for-3 for 63 yards, a drive capped by a 4-yard TD run by Qualan Jones to put @BUFootball back on top. But, @WVUfootball blocks the extra point and returns it for a two-point play. Bears lead, 37-33.#SicEm, As the DC at LSU and Wisconsin prior to coming to Baylor,   @CoachDaveAranda has had 31 players drafted since 2012. But, he was just as excited watching four @BUFootball players taken in this year's NFL Draft.\nhttps://t.co/pP0enKD2QP, Great fight by @BUFootball , but Bears come up short in 30-23 loss to #6 Oklahoma in @Big12Conference Championship game. Great pressure by OU defense in that last series with a sack and three QB hurries. What's next.#SicEm, Nice drive by @BUFootball offense, but stalls inside the 10. Bears settle for 22-yard FG by @Johndmayers6 to extend lead to 10-3 on road at @TexasTechFB. Bears with 120 yards, including 89 on the ground.#SicEm, After being one play away from winning both games against Oklahoma, @BUFootball coach Matt Rhule says his hope "is that our program takes a step in this game and we make one more play and find a way" to beat @GeorgiaFootball in Wednesday's Sugar Bowl.#SicEm, After lengthy delay after blocked FG, refs rule there was no flag on the play for WVU's Darius Stills running on the field. @BUFootball and West Virginia go to the half in Morgantown all tied up at 7-7.#SicEm, Still trying to find its offensive identity, @BUFootball should benefit from a full-strength O-line for Saturday's 2:30 p.m. game at @McLaneStadium. Check out the Five Keys for the   Revilvary.\nhttps://t.co/A0mO3pCueq, Not sure if @BUFootball coach Matt Rhule could have scripted this one any better. Two quick 3-and-outs by defense, a blocked punt, a nice return and two touchdowns for the offense. All that adds up to a 14-0 lead over SFA.#SicEm, Saying he's been "underrated my whole life," @BUFootball receiver Denzel Mims has a chip on his shoulder after being drafted by the New York Jets in the second round with the 59th overall pick. \nhttps://t.co/kTSFaZwIIb, On the field, @CoachDaveAranda handles everything with @BUFootball. Meet @Austin_Thomas55, the Bears' Head Coach Off The Field. \nhttps://t.co/ds8o8gtMf2, Whether it's Gerry Bohanon returning from a hamstring injury or @BShapen making his first collegiate start, the key for @BUFootball versus @TexasTechFB this week will be the Bears' running game.\nhttps://t.co/mmD6kG1AmC, Big-time answer for @BUFootball after @TXSTFootball touchdown. Bears drive 96 yards in nine plays and score on a 35-yard bootleg run by @BShapen on a 4th-and-1 play. Bears lead 21-7 at the half. And now they get @dillondoyle_ back for the 2nd half. #SicEm, About a 10-point swing there late when @BUFootball didn't recover a muffed punt return by the Cyclones. Aided by a 15-yard penalty on the defense, Brock Purdy leads them on drive to set up 38-yard FG with 4 ticks left. Bears go into halftime leading 21-13.#SicEm, No need for words for @BUFootball safeties @Christianm_4 and JT Woods. They've been together so long that "I can just look at Christian and point," Woods said, "and we both know exactly what we're saying."\nhttps://t.co/Xt6XjLdlOZ, Matt Rhule told him he would "miss it." Sure enough, long snapper Ross Matiscik did miss playing linebacker for @BUFootball. Now that he's back on defense, he realizes just how much he missed it. \nhttps://t.co/aNRC8tqn5m, Denzel Mims with a big-time catch on 4th down, scores from 20 yards out on pass from Charlie Brewer. @BUFootball and TCU tied at 23-23 going to third overtime in Fort Worth. That's two fourth-down catches for touchdowns in this game.#SicEm, That punt return for TD by Grayland Arnold was @BUFootball 1st since Levi Norwood vs. Texas Tech on Nov. 16, 2013. Bears lead UTSA 28-0 with 2:02 left in the 1st half. Last year, it was 20-13 at the half.#SicEm, After opting to return for a 5th year, @cmorgan_4 is easily the most experienced safety for @BUFootball. And like the rest of the room, he's cross-training at different spots, including the star that @JalenPitre1 made his own. \nhttps://t.co/kvK0b4QxzC, Making his @Big12Conference Football Media Day appearance, @CoachDaveAranda talked about @BUFootball trying to "do simple better." The Bears have a ton of experience returning on defense and added impact transfer @Jackfish801 from LSU. \nhttps://t.co/tyddohM0Mm, With Gerry Bohanon now at QB, John Lovett goes over 100 yards for the fourth time in his career. Nice night for junior running back as @BUFootball looking to extend 42-7 lead on SFA.#SicEm, Frustrated by how he was punting, @IssacPower43 said he just had to get out of his head. So, he went out and averaged 54.5 yards per kick in @BUFootball's 31-29 win over then-No. 14 Iowa State. "Cherish the victories, no matter what they are," he said.\nhttps://t.co/pbxIzO2NFN, Call it the Lynch mob defense. James Lynch comes up with a sack, then Blake Lynch gets @BUFootball 1st pick of the season, take over at the SFA 34.#SicEm, An inside LB when @CoachDaveAranda showed up at Baylor, @JayyPitree is a perfect fit for the @BUFootball defense STAR position that's more of a hybrid LB/S. In his debut there, he had 7 tackles, 2 TFL and one PBU in Bears' 47-14 win over Kansas. \nhttps://t.co/uAkf0qhAIJ, For 3rd time in his career, @BUFootball LB @dillondoyle_ found the end zone, scoring on a 1-yard TD pass from @BShapen to help the Bears beat Iowa State, 31-24, for their first win in Ames since 2016. Happy homecoming for Doyle, who grew up in Iowa City.\nhttps://t.co/n84iXKV6zI, Here's a stat to remember for Saturday's game. @BUFootball is one of 11 teams that has yet to turn it over, while @TXSTATEFOOTBALL has a bad habit of giving it away with 3 picks and 3 fumbles. Check out the five keys for BU-TXST:\nhttps://t.co/Uk2G9byHPH, No question, this @BUFootball team will be back. Come up short of school-record 12th win but fight to the end in 26-14 loss to @GeorgiaFootball in @SugarBowlNola. Bears finish 11-3 and will have a lot of key pieces coming back. Thank you to an unbelievable group of seniors.#SicEm, While enjoying the two-year ride from 1-11 to 11-1 with Saturday's 61-6 win over Kansas, @BUFootball also gave us a glimpse into the future with freshman QBs Gerry Bohanon and Jacob Zeno, RB Qualan Jones and others getting quality snaps in the 2nd half.\nhttps://t.co/OWnsYtNtfW, Heck of a day so far for @BUFootball QB Gerry Bohanon. Engineers 8-play, 60-yard drive, capped by an Abram Smith 4-yard run to give Bears 28-7 lead at Kansas. Bohanon is 14-of-17 for 207 yards and two TDs.#SicEm, On drive that started with big 60-yard kickoff return by Josh Fleeks, Charlie Brewer scores on 4-yard TD run to give @BUFootball its first lead of the game, 10-6, at the 13:03 mark in 2nd quarter.#SicEm, Even after 4 years at Tulsa, @jaxon_player still calls Waco home. The @BUFootball 5th-year senior D-lineman "has been loving Baylor since i was a kid, and now i get to rep the green and gold."\nhttps://t.co/PKwQbLuZwn, Denzel Mims felt like he let the team down last year when “they needed me to make plays.” But the @BUFootball receiver stepped up in a big way this year.\n\nhttps://t.co/y24mZFSwR5, With @TerrelBernard_2 coming back from a shoulder injury and @dillondoyle_ having a year under his belt in @CoachRonRoberts , @BUFootball has one of the more impressive linebacking duos in the @Big12Conference,\nhttps://t.co/kqJcL5oLzb, OU threatens, but @BUFootball defense holds and Sooners' Gabe Brkic misses a 51-yard FG just barely right. Bears have ball back at their own 35.#SicEm, Before this game, Iowa State QB Brock Purdy had thrown 3 interceptions in 193 attempts in six games. Tonight, @BUFootball defense has picked off three passes in 1st 10 attempts. Bears lead 21-7 with 7:21 left in first half.#SicEm, Monaray Baldwin almost takes it house for a 74-yard gain, then freshman Richard Reese scores his 14th touchdown of the season from 1 yard out. @BUFootball leads No. 4 @TCUFootball 28-20 with just under 10 minutes to go.#SicEm, After a short punt, @TexasTechFB makes it a one-score game, 23-18, with a two-yard plunge by Brooks on third-and-goal. Bowman misses an open receiver underneath on 2-point conversion play. @BUFootball will get the ball back with 11:48 left in the game.#SicEm, Mayers boots 24-yard FG to cut deficit to 9-6. Little bit of a missed opportunity after @BUFootball got the ball at the 8-yard line on Terrel Bernard interception. But, we have a three-point game here in Fort Worth with 14:34 left in the game.#SicEm, Joy stick move by Denzel Mims. This receiving corp for @BUFootball is special.#SicEm, Saturday's Big 12 opener between @BUFootball and @CycloneFB is a matchup of two of the league's top QBs in Baylor junior Charlie Brewer and Iowa state sophomore Brock Purdy, who's become "elite" in his timing passing game.\nhttps://t.co/3eajVXvQJW, Defense for @BUFootball  forces two straight 3-and-outs and gets the offense the ball back close to midfield. Still no score in Manhattan between Bears and Wildcats.#SicEm, Here's a crazy number: @BUFootball returns every single player that produced those 668 yards total offense in the Texas Bowl victory over Vanderbilt. Co-OC Jeff Nixon has to smile when he thinks about the depth this team has now compared to two years ago.\nhttps://t.co/mXNrjuEERI, That's Denzel Mims' 25th career TD reception, moving him into sole possession of fifth place all-time for @BUFootball. Bears lead #8/10 Oklahoma, 14-3, late in the 1st quarter here at McLane Stadium.#SicEm, BYU answers with an 8-play, 75-yard drive and take 7-3 lead on @BUFootball with a 1-yard TD run by Tyler Allgeier. Until that drive, Cougars had just 1 first down and 14 total yards in two series.#SicEm, The @BaylorSACE December Champions of the Month include Big 12 and Sugar Bowl Champion @connorgalvin76, who is also one of the 4 @BUFootball senior offensive linemen who opted to return for another year.\nhttps://t.co/awp9jzzQeq, JaMycal Hasty scores on 5-yard TD run after an 18-yard catch. Bears win it, 33-30, in 2OT. @BUFootball Bowl eligible at 6-0.#SicEm, @JimWright32 @BUFootball @VoiceofBears That would have been radio engineer and great friend, Bobby Baker, as the photog. He's actually the one who suggested we take it., After struggling on 1st three series, @BUFootball goes 86 yards in eight plays, even with a sack, and go up on the TD catch by RJ Sneed. Charlie Brewer was 3-for-3 for 50 yards, plus WV was hit with a 15-yard targeting penalty on safety Josh Norwood. Bears lead, 7-0.#SicEm, Charlie Brewer is a tough son of a gun. On third-and-goal from the 2, @BUFootball QB rolls right and then barrels in for the TD run. Bears regain lead, 31-27, with 9:04 left in the game.#SicEm, What a difference just one year makes. Last year, @CoachShawnBell had virtually no experience in the @BUFootball QB room. Now, he has a 12-game starter and the MOP of the Big 12 Championship game. Competition "brings out the best in all of us."\nhttps://t.co/WEedxi7423, Gerry Bohanon has been in for two series and has rushed for 94 yards on just five carries and led @BUFootball to two touchdowns. This one was a 1-yard run by JaMycal Hasty. Bears lead UTSA, 49-0, with 6:11 left in the half.#SicEm, K-State drives 61 yards in 11 plays, but @BUFootball defense stiffens again and Wildcats have to settle for another field goal by Blake Lynch. Bears lead 17-6 with 21 seconds left in the 3rd quarter. Baylor will get the wind in 4th quarter.#SicEm, A 35-yard run by Sewo Olonilua sets up 47-yard FG by Griffin Bell to give TCU the early 3-0 lead on @BUFootball. That's the first time opponent has scored on the defense on the first drive of the game.#SicEm, After going 2-for-2 today (so far), @BUFootball is 11-of-14 for the year on 4th-down conversions. That's crazy. Bears lead West Virginia, 45-13, in 4th quarter.#SicEm, After working with him for two years, @CoachDaveAranda is pulling for @JoeyMcGuireTTU and a Tech staff, because "I know the type of people they are and what it means to all of them" . . . Just not when @BUFootball plays the Red Raiders Saturday in Lubbock.\nhttps://t.co/76URLgpCOx, What a drive! Sparked by a 56-yard pass from @BShapen to @gavinholmes_ , @BUFootball goes 85 yards in just five plays and scores on a one-yard TD run by tight end Ben Sims. Bears take first lead, 10-7, early in 2nd quarter.#SicEm, West Virginia comes up with its second turnover of the day and second fumble recovery by Jasir Cox. @BUFootball still leads 37-33 with 9:01 left in the game, but is minus-2 in turnovers. Defense needs to come up big here.#SicEm, After that nice hurdle against Iowa State, @BUFootball tight end @DabneyDrake09 may get a shot with @BaylorTrack in the spring. Watch out Nathaniel Ezekiel, this 6-5, 251-pound beast is coming for you. Whatcha think, @MichaelFordBU?\nhttps://t.co/kmV0hSEqAd, @BUFootball starts a drive in SFA territory for the 3rd time, but a holding penalty leaves the Bears w/ a 3rd-and-18 as we start the 2nd quarter. Let's see what OC Jeff Nixon has up his sleeve for this one.#SicEm, The @Big12Conference  decision to move forward, and an updated schedule for @BUFootball, took a "weight off (the players') shoulders," says @CoachDaveAranda. Bears will play non-con game likely Sept. 12 and open league play at home against Kansas Sept. 26.\nhttps://t.co/VTH6UjF3lm, That's how you answer. @BUFootball drives 75 yards in 11 plays and scores on yes, another Reese TD for 31-17 lead. Reese has 138 yards and ties career high with third touchdown. Bears extend lead on @TexasTechFB to 31-17 with 12:46 left in the game.#SicEm, Dennis Johnson and Jorge Munoz were part of LSU's national championship team last season. But, they were more than happy to join @CoachDaveAranda with @BUFootball. \nhttps://t.co/RgWfwKecth, Just what the doctor ordered. @BUFootball opens with a methodical 13-play, 75-yard drive and takes a 7-0 lead on freshman @RichardReese's 14-yard TD run. Bears ate up nearly 6 1/2 minutes off the clock and completed passes to 5 different receivers.#SicEm, With 21 minutes still left in this one, @BUFootball with five takeaways and a 48-0 lead on Kansas in the third quarter after JaMycal Hasty's third TD run of the day.#SicEm, One thing that hasn't helped is six penalties for 55 yards, with a lot of those going against the @BUFootball offensive line. This one is far from over, though. Bears will get the 2nd-half kickoff and see if the offense can get something going to get back in the game.#SicEm, After running just four plays in two 3rd-quarter series, @BUFootball needs to answer Oklahoma's 2nd touchdown of second half, which makes it a 31-24 game with 12:58 left in the game. On the field for over 15 minutes in 2nd half, defense looked tired on that last OU drive.#SicEm, UT, which really hadn't done much offensively the whole half, gets a 68-yard run from Keontay Ingram off the goal line and gets Horns in field goal range at @BUFootball 30 with 5 seconds left in half. Bears leading, 7-0.#SicEm, This was @BUFootball issue last year in Ames when the Bears were 2 of 7 on red zone chances. Charlie Brewer hit the big pass to Denzel Mims and gets Baylor inside the 20, but Mims misses a catch on 3rd down and John Mayers missed a 38-yard FG.#SicEm, First turnover of the day for either team. JT Woods recovers a muffed punt return at the UTSA 16-yard line. @BUFootball leading Roadrunners 49-14 in 4th quarter.#SicEm, Matt Rhule says Jeremy Scott "takes tremendous ownership of what happens in the weight room and is willing to listen to new ideas." That's why @BUFootball is "always on the forefront of things that are out there."\nhttps://t.co/YJxThAVNTI, With that scoop and score, @BUFootball is now plus-1 on turnover ratio (2-1). Sanders had a costly first-half pick in the end zone and just lost that one on the fumble. Bears lead OSU, 38-27, midway through 4th quarter in Stillwater.#SicEm, Matt Rhule's recruiting pitch for @BUFootball is simple: Players are going to get a good education, they're going to get pushed out of their comfort zone and go back home different than when they left. "You go back better."\nhttps://t.co/mJNlzSTCq4, Gerry Bohanon goes out with a hamstring injury, but @BShapen completes 4-of-5 for 42 yards and leads @BUFootball to a 22-yard FG on final play of half to extend lead to 17-7 at K-State.#SicEm, Taking advantage of the first turnover, a fumbled punt return by A.J. McCarty, @BUFootball takes 7-0 lead on a 6-yard TD run by @TrestanEbner at K-State.#SicEm, Baylor is 2-0 on the coin toss a deferred for the second straight week. @BUFootball coach Matt Rhule likes to win everything.#SicEm, John Mayers is good from 36 yards out, extends @BUFootball lead on #17 Iowa State to 24-10 after fumble recovery by deep snapper Gunnar Royer at the Cyclones 21. All 24 points by Bears have come off Iowa State turnovers, although one of them was an 89-yard drive.#SicEm, Think Dexter's Laboratory meets the Incredible Hulk. That describes @dillondoyle_, one of the leaders of the @BUFootball defense going into his 3rd year as the starting MLB. \nhttps://t.co/9IK8qmBR0w, Every once in a while I get something right. When "Voice of the Bears" asked me what kind of game I was expecting out of @BUFootball and Texas Tech. I said it would be more of a defensive game. OK, maybe I didn't expect a 6-3 game at the half. But . . . #SicEm, Moving from tight end to offensive tackle paid big dividends for @BUFootball alum Jason Smith. Turned into All-American as a senior, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft and now headed to the @BaylorAthletics Hall of Fame. Congrats, J-Smooth!\nhttps://t.co/kuVeEF00hu, Saturday's game in Ames between @BUFootball and @CycloneFB could come down to who can run the ball against two of the best defenses in the Big 12. Baylor freshman Richard Reese is coming off a 156-yard game against Texas State.\nhttps://t.co/9stwHKJ4xs, With his second TD run of the night, this time from 35 yards, Abram Smith goes over 100 yards. For the 2nd-straight game, @BUFootball has a pair of 100-yard rushers with Smith and Trestan Ebner. Bears have rushed for 251 yards and leads Texas Southern, 35-0.#SicEm, Zeno hits Chris Platt for 78 yards to set up a game-tying, 27-yard FG by John Mayers, his 2nd of the day, and we're all tied up here in Arlington. @BUFootball and Oklahoma are knotted at 23-23 with 3:25 to go in @Big12Conference Championship game. What an unbelievable game.#SicEm, Special teams coordinator Mike Siravo has no doubt about the kickers for @BUFootball. But, until you get them out there in a game, "You just don't know what's going to happen. It's about getting them out there and getting them settled."\nhttps://t.co/9BrmRYoV9a, Each of the 14 prospects at @BUFootball Pro Day had something to prove. "Most people say I'm a track guy playing football," said @KaayBarnes, who ran 4.23 at the NFL Combine, "but I'm trying to show I'm a football guy."\nhttps://t.co/t4sJ6ecqcs, James Lynch, Bravvion Roy and James Lockhart give @BUFootball an experienced and talented defensive front. But, there's also a young group of d-linemen that will get you excited about the future. \nhttps://t.co/K52OkIr4LR, After nice drive, @BUFootball gets on the board 1st with 31-yard FG by freshman Isaiah Hankins. Bears lead #19 BYU, 3-0 late in the 1st quarter. Defense has only allowed 14 total yards in 2 series.#SicEm, In Saturday's Big 12 opener against Iowa State, the @BUFootball offense has to take what the defense gives them and the defense needs to get off the field on third down. Check out the Five Keys for the game.\nhttps://t.co/OJReqmx0Lh, Probably not game any of us expected but all tied up at 14-14 between @BUFootball and West Virginia going to 4th quarter. Bears facing 3rd-and-5 from their own 39 as we start the final quarter. Baylor has out-gained WVU, 332-175. But Mountaineers have hit the big plays.#SicEM, ...]</td>

      <td>[@jack_eyes Yeah, I swear the number of times I saw "Leeds look... tired?" must've been in double figures following the next few losses, @jack_eyes I dread to think how many incredible looking places I didn't appreciate on family holidays when I was younger, @jack_eyes They lost that after 2016, although it's still on Eurosport I think. The Masters tournaments are going to Amazon after this year. We've considered moving but there's too much stuff waiting to be watched on the Sky box, solid reason, @jack_eyes Hesitancy seems less common in tennis too, think I read 97 of the men's top 100 are vaccinated. I still see Djokovic reaching 25 with his Australia &amp;amp; Wimbledon dominance &amp;amp; struggle to see Nadal matching that if it is a chronic foot injury. But then I didn't see this coming either, @davidjaca @jack_eyes At least they're seemingly completely blind to the idea of appointing a good manager so hopefully we don't have to worry about them winning it, @AshDigsFilms @jack_eyes @davidjaca I nearly went Handanovic and Davids instead of Toldo and Nedved, I think Handanovic would be a perfect five a side keeper but was seduced by more midfield creativity, @jack_eyes Bishop? Christ, that's harsh. I only listened because I'd seen he was on, it's the first Thursday one I've heard in months as Alexander is always on, @ThatChris1209 @kieran_delaney @jack_eyes @Byronchenko @graham020 No, somehow I missed that so I'll give it a listen, cheers, @seanrleahy @Migraine_Boy @jack_eyes I can never understand why people resort to scissors when presumably there's a knife and fork available, which is a better option than a pizza cutter anyway, @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 Her phone I think, it's probably in my other pocket, @jack_eyes Brad from Neighbours has aged well, @jack_eyes Can't wait for this week's video @rachhazza, @markmcdonagh01 @jonny_varley @jack_eyes That is very tempting, @jack_eyes Even if it goes wrong I'm glad the next two are on TV, sometimes I think watching it is worse for my nerves but it definitely isn't, @jack_eyes @laurajane____ I semi-regularly think about how we didn't know our last Cockpit night was our last. Honestly don't think I could have coped, @jack_eyes @AshDigsFilms There's currently a domestic abuse storyline that feels like it's been running for about five years, I don't watch it but whenever I catch a bit it's pretty much always that. Doesn't seem anywhere near as funny as it used to be, @jack_eyes @di1cox @davidjaca I can't remember if I've ever heard him, not sure if he was on FW at all when I used to listen to every episode. I used to read his articles occasionally though and was always amazed he kept his job, @jack_eyes It's only 10.30-18.30 Monday to Friday so that'll limit people but yeah, I'd be in, @jack_eyes @jonny_varley Yeah, comfortable, in control wins are very rare. And even with last season's good start I don't think we were in the playoff positions most of the time were we?, @AshDigsFilms @jack_eyes Yeah, I found Toby Jones enjoyably ridiculous and there were a few nice horror moments, even just the odd shot here and there, later on. The first one just made me wish I was watching Jurassic Park, @jack_eyes This is a pivotal moment, I hope you make it absolutely clear that it can't bounce first, @Terry_Nutkin @jack_eyes He might be or he might go the same way as Hart, Robinson, Foster and so on. I won't write his future off and I'd probably take him in the squad but he's not as good at the moment as I thought he looked at Sunderland, @AshDigsFilms @jack_eyes Had a look and I'm still not seeing it. The upcoming TV series is listed on there if that's what you mean?, @jack_eyes @GemStGem I'd love to see a breakdown of your calorie and grease intake that evening, @jack_eyes @AshDigsFilms You won't be surprised that I agree but yeah, Ronaldinho was basically done as a great player at what, 27 or 28? Plus he didn't quite have the big moments Zidane did in WC 98 or CL 02, or one great overall tournament like Zidane in 2000, @jack_eyes @Michael_TSB Ha ha, glad to see the word spreading. I swear he gets closer to the corner flag every time I see it, @jack_eyes Ah yeah, I forgot you could do that, @jack_eyes It's weird how it has no correlation to normal football, you'd think it'd at least guarantee a consistently good first touch. I'm now reasonably confident I'll break my target of 3000, @AshDigsFilms @jack_eyes Apart from the big moment I thought Hereditary was terrible. Midsommar could've been great if it was half an hour shorter, still really enjoyed it though. But we've got quite different taste in horror, I liked Get Out (and I think It Follows) a fair bit more than you two did, @seanrleahy @jack_eyes It's such good stuff, I definitely need to go back and finish it. I think I stopped when we weren't allowed to play as it was getting me down. Although yeah, in the grand scheme of things nothing to complain about, the stuff about losing a player must really hit hard, @jack_eyes The dream. There's another 4 months of growth in that snap, I'm probably looking at another year and some straighteners to reach Horncastle, @jack_eyes Yeah, the pundits plus Motson and Royle constantly going on about the ref being a cheat. It was an obvious foul and Terry was offside as well. Incredible pre-match arrogance too, the whole thing was a summation of why I hated everything around that England team, @markmcdonagh01 @jack_eyes I was very confident in a Spain Germany SF and would be maybe 55/45 in favour of Spain for that, I changed just in case the Spain manager going stopped them reaching the SF, @markmcdonagh01 @jack_eyes It definitely isn't a justification, it was just inevitable that fans of these two clubs were going to gather in numbers that others may not have done. They still shouldn't have done it, @jack_eyes It really makes you wonder how bad someone has to be to not be invited back, @jack_eyes @simonjpoole_ The golden age of coach travel, @jack_eyes Have you been listening to the new (two year old) album? I'm a big fan, should probably have listened to it two years ago, @jezmyers @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 I don't think so. Travel is now easier, pitches are better, teams like Steaua aren't as corrupt and weaker leagues can't sustain great teams anymore. The latter obviously being the saddest factor, @AshDigsFilms @davidjaca @Terry_Nutkin @jack_eyes I can feel a long overdue 90s Serie A VHS watching session coming on, @Keelan1985 @jack_eyes Bargain. I never think to look in Iceland for beer for some reason, @jack_eyes My bad foot is hurting more than it has for months. Must've been that challenge, @jack_eyes @Danph We definitely got told to keep the noise down. Apparently I had five beers and we "shared three bottles of wine", which is a generous way of saying we had a bottle of wine each, @jack_eyes @Byronchenko He blocked me ages ago too, I never interacted with him but think I replied to Byron's tweet agreeing with the sentiment so I presume it was that, @kieran_delaney @jack_eyes Hopefully, because it was on my list anyway I won't blame you too much if I do. I've been neglecting Netflix recently which is why my list has built up so much, half the stuff probably isn't available anymore, @markmcdonagh01 @jack_eyes I really enjoyed it and I hope everyone else did but I do regret not finding a few good bars. As great as the van was even I didn't intend for it to be quite such a sedate weekend, @jack_eyes @davidjaca It's a few years since I saw it but from what I remember I'll be amazed if you don't love A Prophet. Although it is long, I know I liked it but can't remember if it felt too long or not, @jack_eyes Certainly not for the guy next to him. He was properly waving it around a few minutes later, sadly they haven't shown him during the game, @jack_eyes I was thinking that when I saw it was coming but it's eight months since it came out, which seems mental, @jack_eyes A definite flavour of Inzaghi to it, great stuff. Fernandes is just constantly moaning about nothing, @markmcdonagh01 @jonny_varley @jack_eyes Knowing as they did that the Christmas easing was coming it's madness that so many places weren't in tier 3 after lockdown, or lockdown wasn't longer. It's such basic stuff, the more you reduce the numbers the safer it is to mix, @simonjpoole_ @jack_eyes My initial thought was London but I seem to remember it being at night after a gig and a few ales, which wouldn't fit. I could be wrong though, @jezmyers @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 I don't think there is one, beyond reversing globalisation or football decreasing in popularity, both of which seem unlikely. Even if it was well implemented FFFP wouldn't touch Barca, Madrid, Bayern, Man United etc anyway, they generate too much money to be touched by it, @jack_eyes It's almost as if Champions League football was and is good because high level football is good, not because of some silly outdated rule, @jack_eyes You'd think not, I'd be confident he'd take any squad they could realistically assemble down anyway. Looking forward to these words coming back to haunt me next year, @kieran_delaney @jack_eyes Already having nightmares about Ayling trying to mark him on corners. Yesterday was fantastic though, it's quite reassuring to watch someone in the PL looking as clumsy and out of his depth as I'd be, @jack_eyes @fuckthis_imout @Byronchenko @di1cox If I'd spread mine over a few more years I'd definitely have included Nige, he was so so good for a few years, @di1cox @jack_eyes That was great but I'll take Yorkshire Evening Post please. Top Man also a tempter, @jack_eyes @kieran_delaney I do less with a sprint at the end and the resistance set to just over halfway, not sure how much of an incline that'd equate to. For today's stint I'll see how far I can go before it becomes unbearably uncomfortable, @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 @gianluigibuffon It's a massive shame. He usually seems to have a decent grasp of the relative unimportance of football too so it's surprising, he really needs to publicly back down, @jack_eyes Have you managed to get someone else's subscription working on your TV or finally caved again?, @jack_eyes Oatley, Elis James and MacInnes doing one each apparently. Gives me more time to catch up on the Richardson one anyway, @AshDigsFilms @jack_eyes I definitely second Rare Exports but don't watch it yet, it's a Christmas film. If I remember right the nutcase didn't like A Quiet Place, @davidjaca @jack_eyes Seriously. This is probably the least I've ever disliked them and even now I'd have loved them to go out in the group stage, @jack_eyes What would Arsene say?, @jack_eyes @Terry_Nutkin Whichever one Southgate prefers he should commit and give them both of these games in full or it'll end up like 2010 where Rob fucking Green is starting because Hart, the best keeper in the squad by a mile, had barely played internationally, @jack_eyes Can't think of anything better than a Lone Star session with Bridges, @jack_eyes I got a disappointing 10, the pressure of knowing I had to answer them before she did fazed me a bit, @jack_eyes Nope, I watched the game sort of hoping to recapture something but wasn't bothered either way. It's a shame, I used to get so into big England games, @jack_eyes They're showing all four on consecutive nights so I'm recording them, it's a few years since I had an Alien session. Although I might give Resurrection a miss, @rachhazza @jack_eyes No one told me The Cockpit had reopened, @jack_eyes The director seems to know what she's doing with music, there's a great folk song scene in Winter's Bone too. That's definitely not uplifting though, @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 Yeah, I'm glad there's some kind of logic behind it. It probably isn't an ideal year for Leeds and Liverpool to have won, two clubs who've been waiting ages and have fanbases that feel they have a reputation of being visibly passionate to live up to, @AshDigsFilms @jack_eyes Maybe it's better if you watch it more, whenever I see a bit it seems unpleasant, frustrating and drawn out. As a domestic abuse storyline probably should be but it's not what I want from Coronation Street, I want Rita &amp;amp; Norris, Derek &amp;amp; Mavis, Jack &amp;amp; Vera, @jack_eyes @GoalscorerC It must be pushing 10 years I've had it sitting on a pile now, this winter is probably as suitable a time as any to take the plunge, @jack_eyes Was it on today or did you have it recorded? Can't see it on the BBC 1 or 2 listings and obviously need to give it a go, @jack_eyes @davidjaca @AshDigsFilms I think I most recently spotted it on Film4, probably worth keeping an eye on that for it, @ThatChris1209 @jack_eyes Evergreen. It's astonishing to think how much higher quality basically all penalty shootouts would be if they'd just been reading the forums years ago, @jack_eyes @Byronchenko It's embarrassing how badly we misjudged Judy. I'm still confident that Henman's parents are awful though, @jack_eyes Jordan, @jack_eyes Christ, I think I'd have had a breakdown, @jack_eyes @kieran_delaney Yeah. As I understand it we do owe the money so are at fault but it's obviously a completely disproportionate response. They're doing the same thing to other dual nationals too, it's a proper government policy, @jack_eyes It's Theroux at least so it is better than a standard Troy interview, less bluster. He also did your uncle George earlier in the series, @markmcdonagh01 @jack_eyes I'm in, that's the last time I played too, far too long ago, @markmcdonagh01 @jack_eyes I mentioned that two tweets ago, keep up. I didn't watch it but saw the line ups earlier, @jack_eyes I maybe slightly preferred the second as there were a few good moments, although the first was probably better overall. I'm not convinced I need a third one along the same lines but half an hour longer, @mikejhemsley @jack_eyes Surely that can't be right. His Wiki page currently says he's called Dermot O'Dreary so I suspect some excellent banter, @markmcdonagh01 @jack_eyes 50/50ish, it wasn't as bad a decision as they're all making out but with him not giving it initially I don't think he should have overturned it and he shouldn't be allowed to watch it in slow motion, @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 Sessions, @jack_eyes The boycott lives on, @scobbo @jack_eyes I'm not sure but I read it as them being concerned that the clubs might not use the money to pay the staff on lower wages. It's apparently agents saying this so not necessarily people with the most honourable intentions themselves, @Byronchenko @jack_eyes It's weird, I don't remember that Italy v Wales FA Cup tie that apparently has some special significance for Palace fans, @jack_eyes I was thinking that but I would prefer it to seeing Ashley Barnes's horrible fucking face running off celebrating, @Byronchenko @jack_eyes I wish that had been a deliberate seven year callback rather than just consistency, @graham020 @jack_eyes Brazil loses points for me because of the final, utterly devastating, @jack_eyes @markmcdonagh01 Serious front two, @jack_eyes I'm still putting it down to Transmission, you seemed ok when you went to the bar after you'd had this. Seriously swift decline, @jack_eyes I was just thinking this isn't what watching Leeds feels like, I'm enjoying it and I'm not nervous, @rachhazza @jack_eyes I trust you've got a big screen sorted for showing Scotland v England at the wedding? 5pm ko should fit in perfectly, @jack_eyes Ah, I'd never heard of him so didn't know what Jimbo was on about, @kieran_delaney @jack_eyes Cheers, I'll have a look, ...]</td>

Same thing with solar, storage too btw, @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 I love the "it's held by stronger hands", @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG No question, but note the pace, Just in case it is not clear, on general right wing governments put fossil fuels above just about everything else.

Heck even your ethernet cables can transmit power. Aside from higher cost, this is why it is ridiculous to think that hydrogen, natural gas, etc will win. In addition, solar reduces t&amp;amp;d losses, and ACDC conversion, @Frank_McG 43, but I always wonder what the point is of these, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 https://t.co/y9lUZEoFMJ, @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean @JonMacdonald63 The "velvet rut" that the Ontario Hydro interviewer told me he didn't want me to fall in, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 https://t.co/mG0mTcque0, @Frank_McG @kcnickerson @pkedrosky @IvanTheK I know that when I drive an ICE, I feel like I am going back in time. Simple things like having to turn on and turn off the engine, and having to use the brakes., @Frank_McG of course, the resistance to it is ridiculous, @SMTuffy @Frank_McG So reminiscent of the dot com bubble. A Solution chasing a problem to solve. Then even if it found one, why would it be better than...what is being done already?, @Frank_McG @PeterForint @mcgilcoli Yes I guess definitionally since they are small in the current and directing their offering towards the future., @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean @JonMacdonald63 @u2zepp1 https://t.co/DbW91x8cfU, @volatilitysmile @Frank_McG @elSchtaunko @kcnickerson I'll wager that this is one of those experiments whose results will not be able to be replicated by other people.

You "know" it is a scam, but it takes a while to play out. In the meantime, so many others get taken, and it is frustrating, @Frank_McG @JakartaDean @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 Personally don't think it is a good idea. I have never come close to this being an issue in 6-1/2 yrs of driving an ev, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG Circle. The good news is that these people are self-identifying and therefore can be addressed more effectively, @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 @u2zepp1 @Frank_McG https://t.co/GMwPGcdMaP, @Frank_McG @volatilitysmile @kcnickerson @pkedrosky @dkedrosky @MarcLevesqueEco @markrmcqueen @Schtaunkhauser @ScottTerrioHMA @GravitasMSN Noone is listening it seems, @Frank_McG https://t.co/zhIVLeyMo8, @Frank_McG @BlairFalconer66 @jmwensley Batteries can work on the denominator and numerator of the $/kwh unlike other storage tech.  The technology and supply chain already exists on a massive scale. That is why fossil fuel bro takes like "it can't be scaled, are dopy and they keep being "surprised" about adoption, @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 @JakartaDean @u2zepp1 @Frank_McG @jmarks63   I am shocked shocked! wasn't this always only about vaccine s? https://t.co/w3pPoDEL6X, @EdPonikvar @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @OnuskaFrank Ed, is right, particularly for me as an als fan., @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 Me too, @GeraldKutney @Frank_McG Oh, they have other tactics. They have largely moved on from that. They are on to "it is real, but are we sure about the effects? About the timing?" And "we can't do anything to change". As a cleantech guy this really bugs me because we have the Solns already (solar,EV,storage), @JonMacdonald63 @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean 6hrs! https://t.co/CppzAH8BOG, @ScottTerrioHMA @Frank_McG Progress, @jabe8 @Frank_McG All of the important players have already learned the lesson that hydrogen is not going anywhere from a transportation standpoint. Watch what their r&amp;amp;D and capital is spent on., @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 @OnuskaFrank https://t.co/7x45wMad9m, @Frank_McG It is ridiculous that Canadians are so fixated on it, and it hurts us. like the US Constitution , because it is fetishized,it cannot be changed even though it is outmoded, @Frank_McG This one is circulating around but much of it is already been debunked. It is a very different thing to continuously run the town or stadium rather than periodically charge. You can use batteries, power electronics and even local generation to manage much of this, @TheStalwart @Frank_McG @tracyalloway Honestly not sure why asml is being singled out here. They are just one example and probably not the best that I've seen, @JonMacdonald63 @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli And money to grift, @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean @JonMacdonald63 @Frank_McG  I don't know why it took me so long to reach this point https://t.co/S6wuCEaKPJ, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG https://t.co/hkL11T5KLu, @Frank_McG @carney Yep, we need less energy in a full renewable and electrified system, @EddyElfenbein @Frank_McG Je me souviens, @EdTubb @Frank_McG Needs to be compared with baseline mortality to draw inferences, @pkedrosky @Frank_McG I have seen this all through my thread, with the implication that EVs are going to slow down, which clearly they have not.  In any case,  $6k on a $50K car is a 12% increase, less than car prices have gone up. 2nd, noone is buying spot materials, so increase is less than that, @Frank_McG But you are not playing enough hockey, @Frank_McG More have been bad then good, @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 @JakartaDean @mcgilcoli Narrator: this protest is not about truckers and it is not about vaccines, @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 @JakartaDean @mcgilcoli just ridiculous https://t.co/LXppDSrrBK, @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 @JakartaDean @mcgilcoli Always always take the under on prices where you have technologies like solar and batteries that can work the denominator and numerator. Always take the over on volume deployed because of this continually "surprising", in a  "I am shocked, shocked " way cost advantage., @Frank_McG We can, but will we?, @TallWierdo @Frank_McG @bruce_arthur That too. Double vaccinated, masked and outdoors is manageable risk apparently given the data, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @JakartaDean @BlairFalconer66 @jmarks63 Thinking about this more. It is spring, clocks go forward. Some people are thinking about a different and better future. Some, like,Mr. White, appear to want to rewind the clock back to some gauzily lit neverland where climate risk, stranded assets, and externalities don't exist, @JonMacdonald63 @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @JakartaDean https://t.co/dtm0Bfr2xB, @Frank_McG @SK8Wireless @CPC_HQ @PierrePoilievre No it is not, it is revenue neutral, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 https://t.co/jYgFjj0k20, @JonMacdonald63 @OnuskaFrank @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli\n@JakartaDean we talked about this\nhttps://t.co/NsZe0JiIAk, @dollaretteco @Frank_McG Alpha dogs, @SabrinaMaddeaux @Frank_McG So..like Europe or any other urban centre?, @Frank_McG @OnuskaFrank @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean https://t.co/X2BPHTA2T4, @Frank_McG @carney Remember the "but cobalt", well no shortage now. I always find it interesting that we assume that some can develop oil to meet demand but not minerals that will replace oil., @elSchtaunko @Frank_McG @ScottTerrioHMA This is the correct answer. The fact that a high % of LP fams do not have to make a choice btwn LP house, cottage, ski chalet is..... ridiculous, Oh no!! Growing up around Montreal in the 70s, he really was that big\n@mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @EdPonikvar https://t.co/4XoGUJ8xBr, @ScottTerrioHMA @Name__Expired @Frank_McG @GravitasMSN Essentially Canada has been doing this regional equalization payments and employment programs for decades.  The question is whether we are going to add on to that with home insurance backstops?, @ColinMcGillx @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 @JakartaDean https://t.co/9jZNpwmdru, @JonMacdonald63 @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean @Frank_McG we were just talking about this. Just about every complaint they have is actually provincial jurisdiction. Heck, even the vaccine requirement for truckers going into the USA is a USA mandate. https://t.co/bspwM3np1Z, @ColinMcGillx @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 https://t.co/G4wbV7GfRt, @EdPonikvar @Frank_McG @JakartaDean @mcgilcoli https://t.co/MQb6uBKNCA, @Frank_McG @carney You are right on both points. We had better get used to kwh., @kinsellawarren @Frank_McG That's because there are very few real ones now, @JonMacdonald63 @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean good riddance https://t.co/cp2dRqz8Ee, @JakartaDean @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @BlairFalconer66 https://t.co/pwcSlFavLo, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 https://t.co/L48jKq7axg, @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli That was really good @JonMacdonald63, @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @EdPonikvar Imagine that being the only thing that you are remembered for as an athlete, @Frank_McG Still questions as to what that means. Covid, like other coronaviruses keep mutating, and some have more commonality and thus confer immunity. So, right now the new iteration looks like it has enough commonality that vaccines and previous infection will confer protection, @Frank_McG @JonMacdonald63 @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean I guess Anthony scaramucci has been fully replaced now as relevant time marker. It is now one Kherson or one Truss https://t.co/bYvkQulsEN, @Frank_McG @bsilly3 @carney For sure, @mcgilcoli @Frank_McG @OnuskaFrank @JakartaDean @JonMacdonald63 UK has as per the other article I forwarded. Don't know about Denmark, @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 @u2zepp1 \nsubmitted without comment https://t.co/3V9mm28XaD, High quality thread here on the future of the electric system @JonMacdonald63 @JakartaDean @Frank_McG @mcgilcoli https://t.co/7QXIxrLi47, @Frank_McG I believe that this is a survivorship bias issue. These charlatans, pump and dump and thus have capital to do it again with the next bubble. Eventually you are left with a small number who have had negative behavior reinforced, and who think they are invincible/brilliant, @Frank_McG @zoe_ferry @d_a_keldsen Office and travel have been the worst part. Not too much of an imposition, and worth it, but not ideal, @Frank_McG A lot of corn used for Ethanol, we can do without that, @Frank_McG Saw it in the engineering cafeteria. Will never forget it, @AlgonquinTM @Frank_McG @ScottTerrioHMA That is funny, @fermatslibrary @Frank_McG The laws of thermodynamics are grossly underestimated.. but I'm a mech Eng so..., @mcgilcoli @JonMacdonald63 @Frank_McG @JakartaDean @NatObserver Now you don't, but you did from fox news and our right wing. Remember the poll showing the linkage, @60_glg @TallWierdo @Frank_McG @bruce_arthur Agree, but that emphasizes the point more that this has been happening for months with what one announced small outbreak at a raptors game, @Frank_McG @JakartaDean @u2zepp1 @mcgilcoli The thing that is hilarious about this is the original tweet rightfully points out that in times of high commodity prices Canada charges such low royalties that it is a good place to invest. Yet our governments continue to reduce royalties&amp;amp;taxes so not a great deal for Canadians, @JonMacdonald63 @mcgilcoli @JakartaDean @Frank_McG telling, if real https://t.co/NiiWjlnA5t, @Frank_McG Not much use in this combat unless they are willing to shell densely populated areas, @gemini_gal307 @Frank_McG Get an EV?😉, ...]</td>
